sea <unk> , fell is best known for his <unk> work in new world epigraphy , arguing that various inscriptions in the <unk> are best explained by extensive pre-columbian contact with old world

epigraphy == although fell was an accomplished marine biologist at harvard university , he is best known for three books which claim that many centuries before christopher columbus reached america ,

work came much later , starting in <year> with his publication of america <unk> , in which he proposed translations of inscriptions found on rock surfaces and artifacts in north and south america which he believed to be written in old world scripts and languages . he followed up this work in <year> with saga america and in <year> with bronze age america . fell 's epigraphic work was not well received in academia . critics of fell 's work routinely dismissed him as an amateur , pointing out his lack of formal training in ancient scripts and <unk> scholarly response to fell 's work was prepared by <unk> <unk> and william w. <unk> of the department of anthropology at the smithsonian institution . they stated , in <year> , that `` the arguments of america b.c . are <unk> . the only accepted case of pre-columbian european contact in north america remains the <unk> site of <unk> aux meadows in northern newfoundland . perhaps some day credible proof of other early european contacts will be discovered in the new world . however , america b.c . does not contain such proof and does not employ the standard linguistic and <unk> methods that would be necessary to convince specialists in these fields . `` one example of fell 's claims is his contention in saga america that <unk> of <unk> <month> have reached north america centuries before columbus . this is based on fell 's translation , published in the magazine wonderful west virginia in <year> , of two <unk> inscriptions located at archaeological sites in <unk> and <unk> <unk> , west virginia . according to fell , these inscriptions <unk> the story of christ 's <unk> and are written in an old irish script called ogham , dating back to the <days> or <days> century ad . this led to the publication of articles in

glyphs , complained about fell in a <year> essay : `` fell 's work [ contains ] major academic <unk> , the three worst being <unk> of data , inadequate <unk> of predecessors , and lack of presentation of alternative views . '' in the same essay , however , kelley went on to state that `` i have no personal doubts that some of the inscriptions which have been reported are genuine <unk> ogham . '' kelley concluded : `` despite my occasional harsh criticism of fell 's treatment of individual inscriptions , it should be recognized that without fell 's work there would be no [ north american ] ogham problem to <unk> us . we need to ask not only what fell has done wrong in his epigraphy , but also where we have gone wrong as archaeologists in not recognizing such an extensive european presence in the new world .

'' === adviser to the coal board === after the war , schumacher worked as an economic advisor to , and later chief statistician for , the british control commission , which was charged with rebuilding the german economy . from <year> to <year> he was chief economic adviser to the national coal board , one of the world 's largest organisations , with <other>00,000 employees . in this position , he argued that coal , not petroleum , should be used to supply the energy needs of the world 's population . he saw oil as a finite resource , fearing its <unk> and eventually <unk> price , and viewed with alarm the reality that `` the richest and <unk> reserves are located in some of the world 's most unstable countries '' <unk> position on the coal board was often mentioned later by those introducing schumacher or his ideas . it is generally thought that his <unk> planning contributed to britain 's post-war economic recovery . schumacher predicted the rise of <unk> and many of the problems of nuclear power . === thinking outside the box === in <year> schumacher travelled to burma as an economic consultant . while there , he developed the set of principles he called `` buddhist economics '' , based on the belief that individuals need good work for proper human development . he also proclaimed that `` production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life . '' he travelled throughout many third world countries , encouraging local governments to create self-reliant economies . schumacher 's experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called appropriate technology : <unk> and <unk> suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community ; a concept very close to ivan <unk> 's <unk> . he founded the intermediate technology development group ( now practical action ) in <year>. his theories of development have been summed up for many in catch <unk> such as `` intermediate size '' , and `` intermediate technology '' . he was a trustee of scott <unk> commonwealth and in <year> the president of the soil association . e. f. schumacher was greatly influenced by <unk> gandhi and j. c. <unk> and gandhi 's concepts of `` economy of <unk> '' and appropriate technology . while delivering the gandhi memorial lecture at the <unk> institute of studies at <unk> ( india ) in <year> , schumacher described gandhi as the greatest `` people 's economist '' whose economic thinking was compatible with spirituality as opposed to <unk> . === influence === schumacher was influenced by richard henry <unk> , <unk> gandhi , leopold kohr , <unk> <unk> , karl marx , john ruskin and the catholic church throughout his life . he and his solutions to the great economic problems influence the e. f. schumacher society , the <unk> , george <unk> , william <unk> , and many others . == schumacher as writer == schumacher wrote on economics for london 's the times and became one of the paper 's chief editorial writers . at this post he was assigned the task of <unk> information for the obituary of john <month>nard keynes . he also wrote for the economist and resurgence . he served as adviser to the india planning commission , as well as to the governments of zambia and burma – an experience that led to his <unk> essay `` buddhist economics '' . the <year> publication of small is beautiful : a study of economics as if people mattered , a collection of essays , finished in the house of his friend leopold kohr , brought his ideas to a wider audience . one of his main arguments in small is beautiful is that we can not consider the problem of technological production solved if it requires that we <unk> <unk> our finite natural capital and <unk> future generations of its benefits . schumacher 's work coincided with the growth of ecological concerns and with the birth of environmentalism , and he became a hero to many in the environmental movement and community movement . in <year> , he was awarded the prix européen de <unk> charles <unk> for small is beautiful . his <year> work a guide for the perplexed is both a critique of materialistic <unk> and an exploration of the nature and organisation of knowledge . == later life == as a young man , schumacher was a dedicated atheist , but his later rejection of <unk> , capitalist , agnostic <unk> was <unk> by a growing fascination with religion . he developed an interest in <unk> , but beginning in the <unk> , catholicism heavily influenced his thinking . he noted the similarities between his own economic views and the teaching of <unk> <unk> on socio-economic issues , from leo <unk> 's `` <unk> <unk> '' to pope john <unk> 's mater et <unk> , as well as with the <unk> supported by the catholic thinkers g. k. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and vincent <unk> . <unk> , he absorbed much of <unk> , which provided an objective system in contrast to what he saw as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of modern philosophy and society . he also was greatly interested in the tradition of christian <unk> and read deeply such writers as st. teresa of <unk> and thomas merton . these were all interests that he shared with his friend , the catholic writer christopher <unk> . in <year> , he converted to <unk> gave interviews and published articles for a wide readership in his later years . he also pursued one of the <unk> of his life : <unk> . he died of a heart attack on <integer> <month> <year> , on arrival at <unk> hospital in <unk> , switzerland ;

<month> <integer> , <year> – <month> <integer> , <year> ) was an american economist . he is `` the father of the rational expectations revolution in economics '' , primarily due to his article `` rational expectations and the theory of price movements '' from <year> . muth earned his ph.d. in mathematical economics from carnegie mellon university , and was in <year> the first recipient of the alexander henderson award . he was affiliated with carnegie mellon as a research associate from <year> until <year> , as an assistant professor from <year> to <year> , and as an associate professor without tenure from <year> to <year>. he was a full professor at michigan state university from <year> to <year> and a full professor at indiana university from <year> until his retirement in <year> . muth asserted that expectations `` are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory . '' although he formulated the rational expectations principle in the context of microeconomics it has subsequently become associated with macroeconomics and the work of robert lucas , jr. , finn e. <unk> , edward c. prescott , neil wallace , thomas j. <unk> , and others . == work with holt , modigliani , and simon == two <unk> approaches to economic modeling , which have later become <unk> of modeling of economic systems , originated at the graduate school of industrial administration ( gsia ) at carnegie mellon in the late <year>s and early <year>s . at the same time as john muth was developing the concept of rational expectations , herbert a. simon had been refining his ideas on bounded rationality , emphasizing people 's limited computational abilities . together with their two colleagues at gsia charles c. holt and franco modigliani , muth and simon collaborated on planning production , inventories , and work force ( <year> ) , a book on problems of production <unk> and inventory management for the firm . their goal was to derive <unk> , operational rules that could easily be applied in practice . rather than a <unk> that the two apparently contradictory approaches to economic modeling were developed at gsia at the same time , it is more likely that fruitful interaction in the quest to answer a common set of problems led the two researchers to two different solutions . in an earlier work , <unk> simon had shown that with quadratic costs and under a certain set of assumptions about the probability distributions , optimal decision rules for production and inventories would be linear functions of the variables describing the state . in his model , firms only needed to take into account the expected value and ignore all higher moments of the probability distribution of future sales . this result , known as <unk> equivalence , drastically reduces the computational burden on a representative decision maker . simon 's result that decision makers only focus on expected values of stochastic variables was very sensitive to the assumed structure of the problem , hence indirectly on the formulation of expectations . this lack of a general theory of expectations was an unsatisfactory state of affairs and proved to be key in muth 's approach to solve the problem which has often been termed interaction between expectations and reality . in his article from <year> , muth writes : `` to make dynamic economic models complete , various <unk> <unk> have been used . there is , however , little evidence to suggest that the presumed relations bear a <unk> to the way the economy works . '' == <unk> of friedman 's adaptive expectations model == <unk> cagan , milton friedman and others used the ad hoc <unk> rule which they labeled adaptive expectations to forecast the hidden state y * ( e.g. , permanent income ) . in a <year> paper , muth answered the question : for what stochastic process for y will adaptive expectations as postulated by cagan and friedman be the optimal forecast of y * . muth 's approach to find <unk> optimal linear forecast of a `` hidden '' state vector , x , given an `` observer '' , y is very similar to the <unk> filter , presented by rudolf <unk> in his paper from the same year . in his paper `` optimal properties of <unk> weighted forecasts '' , which was published in the journal of the american statistical association in <year> , muth <unk> friedman 's adaptive expectations model for permanent income . he did this by reverse engineering a stochastic process for income for which cagan 's expectation formula <unk> a mathematical expectation of future values conditioned on the infinite history of past incomes . among muth 's insights was that the stochastic process being forecast should <unk> both the distributed <unk> and the <unk> variables that people use to forecast the future . == hypothesis of rational expectations == in `` rational expectations and the theory of price movements '' , published in <year> , muth put forward his hypothesis , in contrast to simon , that `` expectations , since they are informed predictions of future events , are essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory . '' muth continued , `` at the risk of <unk> this purely descriptive hypothesis with a <unk> as to what firms ought to do , we call such expectations rational . '' muth 's notion was that the professors [ of economics ] , even if correct in their model of man , could do no better in predicting than could the <unk> farmer or <unk> or insurance company . the notion is one of intellectual <unk> .... the common sense is `` rationality '' : therefore muth called the argument `` rational expectations '' . == legacy == muth 's works influenced almost every area of economic research into dynamic problems . of course we knew about [ rational expectations ] . muth was a colleague of ours [ in the early <year>s ] . we just did n't think it was important . the hypothesis was more or less buried during the <unk> . arrow used it in his paper on <unk> in the <unk> . prescott and i used it in that paper of ours on investment . people were aware of it , but i did n't understand then how fundamental a difference it made <unk> . i did n't realize that if you took it seriously you had to <unk> the whole question of testing and estimation . i <unk> no one else did either , except for muth . it must be quite an experience to write papers that radical and have people just pat you on the head and say <unk> 's interesting , ' and nothing happens . muth 's role in the history of economics is unusual . like hermann heinrich <unk> , he became famous for one idea , he provided the analytical key to developments that , in the jargon of scientific journalism , were described as revolutionary , and he was virtually ignored by his immediate contemporaries . however , whereas <unk> had no influence on those developments , his key results being independently rediscovered by <unk> and walras , the rational expectations economics of the <year>s and <year>s was a direct <unk> of muth 's seminal idea . in fact , muth 's contribution is one of the relatively few instances in which there is no <unk> that the history of economics would have taken about the same course in its absence . it was a novel and ingenious idea , it was not `` in the air , '' and no multiple discovery has yet come to light . == major works == charles c. holt , franco modigliani , john f. muth , and herbert a. simon ( <year> ) . planning production , inventories , and work force . john f. muth .

former west indies for britain 's colonial <unk> '' because of the ideas he put forward in this work . === the `` lewis model '' === lewis published in <year> what was to be his most influential development economics article , `` economic development with unlimited supplies of labour '' ( manchester school ) . in this publication , he introduced what came to be called the dual sector model , or the `` lewis model '' <unk> combined an analysis of the historical experience of developed countries with the central ideas of the classical economists to produce a broad picture of the development process . in his theory , a `` capitalist '' sector develops by taking labour from a <unk> backward `` subsistence '' sector . the subsistence sector is governed by informal institutions and social norms so that producers do not maximize profits and workers can be paid above their marginal product . at an early stage of development , the `` unlimited '' supply of labour from the subsistence economy means that the capitalist sector can expand for some time without the need to raise wages . this results in higher returns to capital , which are <unk> in capital accumulation . in turn , the increase in the capital stock leads the `` <unk> '' to expand employment by drawing further labour from the subsistence sector . given the assumptions of the model ( for example , that the profits are <unk> and that capital accumulation does not substitute for skilled labour in production ) , the process becomes self-sustaining and leads to modernization and economic <unk> point at which the excess labour in the subsistence sector is fully absorbed into the modern sector , and where further capital accumulation begins to increase wages , is sometimes called the <unk> turning point . it has recently been widely discussed in the context of economic development in china . === the theory of economic growth ( <year> ) === in his <year> book , the theory of economic growth , lewis sought to `` provide an appropriate framework for studying economic development '' , driven by a combination of `` curiosity and of practical need . `` during the industrial revolution , england was experiencing the worst economic turmoil of its time . it would not be until an economic enlightenment took place that cities began to shift towards factories and <unk> methods of production as they experienced giant shifts in the labour and agriculture markets , thus , eventually leading to higher production , and higher income . lewis theorized if england could turn its <unk> around , the same could be done for developing countries around the world . his theories proved true for some countries such as nigeria and barbados , as they would see some economic development . == selected

he is often credited with writing kennedy 's famous `` new frontier '' speech . prominent for his role in shaping us foreign policy in southeast asia during the <year>s , he was a staunch anti-communist , noted for a belief in the efficacy of capitalism and free enterprise , and strongly supported us involvement in the vietnam war . rostow is known for his book the stages of economic growth : a non-communist manifesto ( <year> ) , which was used in several fields of social science . rostow 's theories were embraced by many officials in both the kennedy and johnson administrations as a possible counter to the increasing popularity of communism in asia , africa and latin america . rostow never regretted or <unk> over his actions in vietnam , and this stance effectively <unk> him from work in top american universities after his retirement from government service . his elder brother eugene rostow also held a number of high government foreign policy posts . == early life == rostow was born in manhattan , new york city , to a russian jewish immigrant family . his parents , lillian ( <unk> ) and victor rostow , were active socialists , and named walt after the poet walt whitman . rostow 's father , victor rostowsky , was born in the town of <unk> near odessa in <year> , and was involved in the russian socialist movement as a teenager , publishing a left-wing newspaper in the <unk> of his parents ' house calling for the overthrow of the emperor nicholas ii . in <year> , at the age of <integer> , victor rostowsky <unk> a ship that took him from odessa to glasgow and another ship that took him to new york . upon arriving in the united states , rostowsky `` <unk> '' his surname to rostow . on <integer> <month> <year> , he married lillian <unk> , the <unk> gifted daughter of russian jewish immigrants who <unk> go to college , but as her family was too poor to afford higher education , she instead encouraged her sons to <unk> the higher education she wanted for herself . like the <unk> , the <unk> were <unk> ( <unk> jews ) . the <unk> were described as being very `` idealistic '' immigrants who deeply loved their adopted country and named their three sons after the three men they considered to be the greatest americans , namely eugene v. <unk> , walt whitman and ralph waldo <unk> many other <unk> jewish immigrants , victor rostow always spoke to his children in english rather than <unk> as he felt this was would improve their chances in life . rostow 's brother eugene , who was named for eugene v. <unk> , became a legal scholar , and his brother ralph , a department store manager . the american journalist stanley karnow described rostow as extremely intelligent with a `` brilliant '' academic record that saw him graduate from high school at the age of <decimal> rostow described his childhood as mostly happy with the only dark <unk> being that sometimes his <unk> called him and his brothers `` <unk> jews '' .rostow 's parents closely followed events in russia and rostow later recalled a defining moment of his life occurred as a teenager when his parents invited over for a dinner a group of fellow jewish socialists together with a man who was serving as a purchasing agent for the soviet government . after the dinner , rostow remembered that his father said : `` these communists took over the <unk> police and made them worse . the <unk> police <unk> the political opposition but never <unk> their families . these people touch families too . nothing good will come of it '' . rostow entered yale university at the age of <integer> on a full scholarship and graduated at <decimal> he then won a rhodes scholarship to study at <unk> college , oxford , where he completed a <unk> . degree . at oxford , rostow became friends with future politicians edward heath and roy jenkins , being especially close to the latter . in <year> , during the edward viii <unk> crisis , he assisted broadcaster <unk> <unk> , who reported on the events for the nbc radio network . after returning to yale university , completing his ph.d. in <year> , he started teaching economics at columbia university . == professional and academic career == during world war ii , rostow served in the office of strategic services under william joseph <unk> . among other tasks , he participated in selecting targets for us <unk> . nicholas <unk> later <unk> : `` i finally understand the difference between walt and me [ ... ] i was the <unk> who was shot down and spent two years in a german prison camp , and walt was the guy <unk> my targets . '' in <month> <year> , rostow arrived in london to serve as an intelligence analyst with the enemy objectives unit , serving until the spring of <year>.in <month> <year> , rostow was given the task of identifying the key industries that supported the german war economy . as an intelligence analyst , rostow became convinced in <year> that oil was germany 's <unk> <unk> , and if the united states army air force were to target the romanian oil fields together with the plants for making artificial oil and oil shortage facilities within germany itself , then the war would be won , a strategy known as the `` oil plan '' . by early <year> , rostow had finally won over general carl <unk> to the merits of the `` oil plan '' . in early <year> , there was much debate about the merits of the `` oil plan '' vs. the `` transportation plan '' of targeting the german and french railroad system . the `` transportation plan '' was implemented first as part of the <unk> to operation <unk> . the `` oil plan '' began to be implemented as a strategy by the army air force in <month> <year> , which rostow later called a disastrous error , claiming if the `` oil plan '' had been adopted earlier , the war would have been won far earlier . he also claimed that the united states would have entered into the cold war in a far stronger position as he always maintained that if `` oil plan '' had been adopted earlier it would have allowed the u.s. army to push <unk> into central europe and even into eastern europe . based on his world war ii experiences , rostow became a convinced advocate of strategical bombing , arguing that it was the bombing campaign against germany 's cities that had won the war . for his work with the enemy objectives unit during the war , rostow was awarded an <unk> <year> , immediately after the war , rostow became assistant chief of the <unk> economic division in the united states department of state in washington , d.c. rostow was invited to part in the united states strategic bombing survey ( ussbs ) , an assessment of the effects of the strategical bombing campaign on germany 's economy , but he declined . several of rostow 's future foes in the <year>s such as george ball , john kenneth galbraith and arthur m. schlesinger jr. did take part in the ussbs , and came away convinced that the strategical bombing campaign did not <unk> the german economy as its advocates had promised , an experience that led these men to doubt the efficacy of bombing north vietnam . through the `` oil plan '' did indeed work as rostow had promised , those taking part in the ussbs also noted that german industrial production <unk> in <month> <year> , which led them to doubt the effects of strategical bombing as a way of breaking a nation 's economy . in <year> , he returned to oxford as the harold <unk> <unk> professor of american history . in <year> , he became the assistant to the executive secretary of the economic commission for europe , and was involved in the development of the marshall plan . one of rostow 's colleagues recalled : `` in early <year> , walt rostow had a revelation that the unity of germany could not be achieved without the unity of europe , and that the unity of europe could best be approached <unk> through technical cooperation in economic matters , rather than <unk> in diplomatic negotiations '' . rostow 's writings on the subject of european economic unity attracted the attention of <unk> of state dean acheson , and ultimately jean <unk> , the french diplomat regarded as the `` father '' of the european coal and steel community of <year> that became the european economic community in <unk> spent a year at cambridge university as the <unk> professor of american history and institutions . he was professor of economic history at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) from <year> to <year> , and a staff member at the center for international studies ( cis ) at the mit from <year> to <year>. the outbreak of the korean war decisively altered rostow 's thinking about the soviet union . until the korean war , rostow had believed that the soviet system would ultimately `` <unk> '' on its own accord and he had also viewed the cold war as a largely diplomatic conflict as opposed to a military struggle . the north korean aggression against south korea convinced him that the cold war required a more <unk> foreign policy as he called for greater defense spending in a speech in the fall of <year> so a `` larger full mobilization could be carried out quickly . '' to pay for the higher amount of defense spending , rostow urged the american people to accept the need for a `` very high level of taxation <unk> equally '' <unk> late <year> to <month> <year> , rostow headed the soviet vulnerabilities project . the project , which was sponsored by the cis and received significant support from the u.s. government , sought to identify soviet vulnerabilities with regard to <unk> warfare , and it received contributions from top <unk> and psychological warfare specialists . in <month> <year> , rostow headed a group of <unk> cold <unk> who were called the <unk> vulnerabilities panel which issued a report that advocated nuclear <unk> of the soviet union . although the experts were invited by nelson rockefeller , their proposal ran contrary to the policy of the eisenhower <unk> <year> , rostow advised president dwight eisenhower on economic and foreign policy , and in <year> he became a speechwriter for him . in <month> <year> , rostow was deeply shocked when he heard of the french defeat at the battle of <unk> <unk> phu , expressing his <unk> that french leaders had failed to create a political <unk> which would `` effectively rally the vietnamese against the communists '' . rostow believed the communist viet minh fighting for independence from france were a small , radical <unk> minority entirely <unk> of the vietnamese people , the majority of whom he believed supported the <unk> , but nominally independent state of vietnam created in <year>. at the same time , he <unk> out at eisenhower for `` <unk> to involve american units in combat '' as a plan had been drafted code-named operation vulture calling for the american intervention in vietnam with tactical nuclear weapons . eisenhower had operation vulture contingent upon british involvement , and when the british <unk> refused to become involved , used that as an excuse not to <unk> operation vulture . in <month> <year> , rostow and fellow <unk> mit economics professor max f. millikan convinced eisenhower to <unk> increase us foreign aid for development as part of a policy of <unk> what he saw as `` <unk> '' economic growth in asia and elsewhere , backed by the military . unlike many of the first generation of `` cold <unk> '' who saw the cold war in essentially <unk> terms , rostow viewed the cold war as a global struggle in which the third world was its most important battlefield . rostow often accused people such as george f. kennan and dean acheson of being <unk> because they viewed europe as being far more important than asia . on <integer> <month> <year> , rostow first met senator john f. kennedy , who was impressed with the academic who understood power . on <integer> <month> <year> , rostow appeared as a witness before the senate foreign relations committee , where as <unk> , kennedy asked him a question about american economic aid to india , which led to the reply the `` present aid program , which amounts to about $ <integer> million this year , is <unk> inadequate '' . the purpose of the testimony was to <unk> eisenhower whom both men believed was <unk> the third world . rostow wrote two speeches for kennedy , which he delivered on the senate floor , attacking the eisenhower administration for ignoring india , while the soviet union was not , and led ultimately india being granted $ <integer> million in exchange credits from the <unk> bank later that year . in <month> <year> , rostow left to take a professorship at cambridge university , where he started writing his magnum opus , a book intended to <unk> marxism as a theory that became the stages of economic growth . at a time when nikita khrushchev was <unk> that the soviet union with its five year plans would soon surpass the united states as the world 's dominant economic power because what he interpreted as marxist theory explained both the past and the future , there was much desire in the american political and intellectual establishments to assess its ideological dimensions . == the stages of economic growth == in <year> , rostow published the stages of economic growth : a non-communist manifesto , which proposed the <unk> take-off model of economic growth , one of the major historical models of economic growth , which argues that economic modernization occurs in five basic stages of varying length : traditional society , preconditions for take-off , take-off , drive to maturity , and high mass consumption . this became one of the important concepts in the theory of modernization in social <unk> . a product of its time and place , the book argued that one of the central problems of the cold war as understood by american decision-makers , namely that there were millions of people living in poverty in the third world whom communism appealed to , could be solved by a policy of modernization to be fostered by american economic aid and growth . rostow began the book with the question about where the world was going , asking `` is it taking us to communism , or the affluent suburbs , <unk> <unk> out with social overhead capital ; to destruction ; to the moon ; or where ? '' using the industrial revolution in britain as his case study , rostow sought to rebut karl marx 's construction of history , arguing that marx 's reading of british history , which he based much of his theories upon , was <unk> . the book was essentially a call for greater american involvement in the third world as rostow wrote that much of the third world was struck in the `` traditional stage '' or `` preconditions for take-off '' stage , but with a little help from the us could reach the `` take-off '' stage . the stages concluded : `` we must demonstrate that the underdeveloped nations ... can move successfully through the preconditions into a well established take-off within the orbit of the democratic world , resisting the <unk> and <unk> of communism . this is , i believe , the most important item on the western agenda . `` <unk> <unk> argues that as an alternative to marxist <unk> analysis rostow replaced class with nation as the agent of history . british history then became the base for comparisons . however rostow never explicitly offered the british case as the ideal model for nations to copy . many commentators assumed that was his goal and attention turned to issues of american <unk> , and the argument that britain created the modern <unk> 's thesis was criticized at the time and subsequently as <unk> a model of western development that could not be replicated in places like latin america or <unk> africa . another line of criticism was his thesis that societies based upon `` mass production '' and `` mass consumption '' like those of the west were the ideal society that everyone in the world wanted to <unk> . at the time , critical reception was extremely <unk> with a book review by harry <unk> in the new york times speaking of rostow 's `` impressive achievement '' of writing `` one of the most influential economic books of the twentieth century '' . in a review in the christian science monitor wrote : `` there is a sharp intelligence at work , producing <unk> and pages which seem to <unk> events to an almost <unk> simplicity . this is the special quality of the writer and the book '' . adlai stevenson wrote in a letter to rostow : `` is the future <unk> vs. marxism ? if so , i am ready to vote now '' . much of the success of the stages at the time was due to the fact that it addressed seminal issues in a style that was easy to understand but was sufficiently intellectual enough not to be dismissed as <unk> and <unk> . like the various theories of marxism that he had hoped to <unk> , rostow offered up a grand theory , in this case , the `` modernization theory '' that explained the past and predicted the future . the swiss scholar gilbert <unk> wrote of `` rostow 's <unk> <unk> of humanity <unk> towards greater <unk> '' and his theories as `` marxism without marx '' as rostow asserted that capitalism was inevitably <unk> to triumph because , in his view , it was the superior system . the american historian michael shafer wrote about the modernization theory as `` a logical construct , <unk> from a set of universal axioms <unk> from the realm of human and <unk> <unk> '' .in south korea , at the time a third world nation , much interest in rostow 's book was expressed by both economists and <unk> . rostow 's concept of `` economic take-off '' especially appealed to the south korean president , general park <unk> , who often used that phrase in his speeches calling for south <unk> to work harder so that their nation could rise up to a first world economy . park , who seized power in a <year> coup d'état , starting in <year> inaugurated a policy of five year plans under which the south korean <unk> had to meet certain targets set by the government as part of the push to reach the `` economic take-off '' stage . a <year> book theory and condition of korean economic development published by the government had <integer> essays by leading economists , of which half described sought to apply the theories set out in the stages of economic growth to south korea . == service under the kennedy and johnson administrations == the stages of economic growth impressed presidential candidate john f. kennedy , who appointed rostow as one of his political advisers , and sought his advice . after attempting unsuccessfully to be appointed to a major post under the eisenhower administration , rostow decided to try his luck with kennedy in <year>. during the <year> election , rostow served as a <unk> and adviser for the kennedy campaign , where he became known as an `` <unk> idea man '' . rostow wrote the speech calling for a `` new frontier '' , which kennedy gave when he won the democratic nomination . the <unk> reception to the `` new frontier '' speech led kennedy to promise rostow a senior position if he won the election . rostow also coined the slogan of kennedy 's <year> campaign `` let 's get the country moving again '' . initially , kennedy wanted to give rostow a major post in his administration . after rostow wrote a policy paper in <month> <year> to outline the incoming kennedy administration 's `` flexible response '' nuclear posture to replace the eisenhower administration 's `` massive retaliation '' nuclear doctrine , in which he stressed that the united states should be willing to use nuclear weapons in southeast asia to counter a `` possible <unk> '' by china , the man whom kennedy nominated to serve as his secretary of state dean rusk , vetoed rostow 's <unk> kennedy became president in <year> , he appointed rostow as deputy to his national security assistant mcgeorge bundy . through rostow was just bundy 's deputy , in practice he served as an equal as initially kennedy was greatly influenced by the advice he received from the renowned , world famous economist . just before kennedy was inaugurated as president on <integer> <month> <year> , on <integer> <month> <year> , the soviet leader , nikita khrushchev delivered a speech in moscow declaring that the soviet union was allegedly able and willing to support any `` war of national liberation '' anywhere in the third world . khrushchev 's speech was largely a response to the sino-soviet split of <year> as mao zedong had accused khrushchev of `` <unk> '' and denounced the soviet union for not supporting third world <unk> and nationalist movements . as such , mao announced that he regarded himself as the proper leader of the world communist movement , causing khrushchev to strike back with his speech in moscow announcing his willingness to support `` wars of national liberation '' . missing the context of sino-soviet <unk> , kennedy and his advisers regarded khrushchev 's speech as a bold new soviet <unk> for world domination , making the subject of the third world a key concern for him . the first meeting of the national security council under kennedy on <integer> <month> <year> was entirely devoted to the subject of the third world with the president reading out excerpts of khrushchev 's `` wars of national liberation speech '' to <unk> the danger . rostow , who always saw the third world as the main `` battlefield '' of the cold war , enjoyed much influence with the new president at first . as the <unk> of the modernization theory , rostow laid out policies to counter communism in the third world . rostow supported the bay of pigs invasion , <unk> with reservations , arguing the existence of a communist government in cuba was unacceptable as otherwise the rest of latin america might be `` infected '' with communism . along the same lines , rostow was the main inspiration for the alliance for progress , a $ <integer> billion aid program for latin america launched with great <unk> by kennedy in <year> who in a speech written by rostow spoke of how the alliance for progress would allow latin america to reach the `` economic take-off '' stage of growth by having an annual growth rate of <decimal> % ( a target chosen by rostow ) , which would end the appeal of communism in latin america forever . rostow was also instrumental in persuading kennedy that the best way to fight communism in the third world in general , not just latin america , was to increase aid , and in <year> american aid to the rest of the third world went up to $ <decimal> billion from $ <decimal> billion in <year>. in a speech written by rostow , kennedy announced that the <year>s would be the `` decade of development '' , saying that the united states was willing and able to <unk> sufficient foreign aid to allow the third world nations to reach the `` economic take-off '' <unk> <unk> kennedy as an `` <unk> man '' , causing him to <unk> that rostow had too many ideas for his own good and was unable to focus on what was really important . kennedy 's main <unk> was that rostow would in a <unk> fashion offer up a <unk> of ideas , which made him hard to follow . kennedy had come into the white house in <month> <year> as a confirmed hawk , who during the <year> election had criticized eisenhower as `` soft on communism '' for not <unk> fidel castro , but the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion in <month> had <unk> his <unk> <unk> . after the bay of pigs invasion , he came to <unk> the hawkish advice he received from the cia and the joint chiefs of staff . as a result , kennedy also rejected the hawkish advice he received from rostow , charging the experts had all told him that the bay of pigs invasion could not possibly fail . just after the bay of pigs invasion , kennedy rejected advice from rostow to send u.s. troops to laos . the economist john kenneth galbraith advised his friend kennedy that laos was not worth a war , and kennedy himself noted to supply forces in laos would present severe logistical problems . finally remembering how the approach of american forces upon the yalu river led to chinese intervention in the korean war , the president was concerned that intervening in laos would cause a war with china that he did not want . instead , kennedy sent the diplomat w. averell harriman to negotiate an agreement to `` <unk> '' laos , which marked the beginning of the feud between rostow and harriman as the former started to see the latter as an <unk> also charged that rostow was too <unk> on vietnam , saying he seemed to have an <unk> with that country as he spent much time talking about vietnam . rostow believed in the `` domino theory '' , predicating that if south vietnam fell , the rest of southeast asia would also fall like so many dominoes , and ultimately india would fall as well . as early as <month> <year> , rostow was advising kennedy to bomb north vietnam . during the berlin crisis of <year> , rostow advised kennedy : `` we must find ways of putting pressure on khrushchev 's side of the line with conventional forces or other means ... we must begin now to present khrushchev with the risk that if he <unk> the berlin crisis , we and the west germans <month> take action that will cause east germany to come <unk> '' . the particular action that rostow advised kennedy to take was to `` take and hold a piece of territory in east germany that khrushchev <month> not wish to lose ( for example , <unk> ) '' . kennedy rejected this advice as too dangerous , stating that having u.s forces seize part of east germany would almost certainly cause a nuclear war with the soviet union . later that year , rostow became director of the state department 's policy planning staff . at the time , kennedy commented : `` walt is a <unk> of ideas ; perhaps one in ten of them is absolutely brilliant . unfortunately six or seven are not merely <unk> , but <unk> so . i <unk> his creativity , but it will be more comfortable to have him creating at some remove from the white house '' <unk> told rostow that his being <unk> from the white house to the state department was because : `` over here in the white house we have to play with a very narrow range of choices ... we ca n't do long-range planning ; it has to be done over there . i want you to go over there and catch hold of the process at the level where it counts '' . appealing to kennedy 's catholicism , rostow complained that : `` i am going from being a <unk> in rome to being a bishop in the provinces . '' in <month> <year> , rostow went on a fact-finding mission with general maxwell taylor to south vietnam and he returned full of enthusiasm for greater american involvement in what he stated `` might be the last great confrontation '' with communism . the report that taylor and rostow wrote advocated that kennedy sent between <other>,000 and <other>,000 u.s army troops to fight in south vietnam under the <unk> of being `` flood relief workers '' . kennedy rejected the <unk> report 's recommendation that he sent troops to fight in south vietnam , but accepted the report 's other recommendations calling for more military and economic aid to south vietnam . karnow described rostow as a man who `` seemed to <unk> in the war '' as it appeared that he wanted to prove that a short , <unk> , <unk> new york intellectual could be just as hard , tough and <unk> as the idealized world war ii veteran that hollywood kept portraying in action films at the time . rostow had served in world war ii as an intelligence analysis with the task of selecting bombing targets in germany , an important , but comfortable `` desk job '' that ensured he never saw combat , a point about which he was very <unk> <month> <year> , president ngo <unk> diem introduced the strategic hamlet program of forcibly <unk> peasants to strategic hamlets as a way of <unk> the population from the viet cong guerrillas . though impetus for the strategic hamlet program came from diem , rostow supported the program as a way of breaking down the `` traditional person '' , arguing that the strategic hamlets would be agents of modernization . he remained <unk> as to why the strategic hamlets were so unpopular with south vietnamese peasants . in <year> , rostow drafted the statement of basic national security policy ( bnsp ) , a <unk> document meant to outline the foreign policy of the kennedy administration . reflecting his interest in the modernization theory , rostow identified the third world , especially `` the arc from <unk> to korea '' as the most important `` battlefield '' of the cold war . through to some extent based upon the theory of `` <unk> '' as argued by george f. kennan in the <year>s , rostow 's bnsp argued for the united states to promote economic growth in the third world and for the creation of `` a wider community of free nations , embracing latin america , africa , asia and the middle east '' . kennan who was serving as the us ambassador in belgrade at the time reviewed the bnsp <unk> criticized the document . kennan attacked rostow 's advocacy of a <unk> nuclear war , writing he would `` rather see my children dead '' than live in a world <unk> by nuclear war . kennan also criticized rostow 's optimism about process in the third world , writing that the third world was <unk> backward and might be a danger to the us if allowed to process . however , some of the statements in kennan 's critique , where he argued that a first world standard of living was `` <unk> to peoples who have had their origins on or near the shores of the north sea '' or to nations <unk> from such peoples like the united states allowed rostow to accuse kennan with some justification of <unk> the cuban missile crisis , rostow was mostly excluded from the decision-making process , having only meeting with kennedy during the crisis where he advised him to stop soviet ships carrying oil to cuba , advice that was not taken . unaware that kennedy had promised not to invade cuba and to <unk> american missiles out of turkey as part of the resolution , rostow saw the cuban missile crisis as a triumph , which proved the superior power of the united states . inspired by the cuban missile crisis , rostow on <integer> <month> <year> called in a memo for the bombing of north vietnam , writing : `` the whole lesson of the cold war including the recent cuba crisis is that communists do not <unk> in response to our actions '' . in <year> , rostow started to advocate what became known in washington as the `` rostow thesis '' , namely if the united states bombed north vietnam along the same lines that germany and japan were bombed in world war ii , then the north vietnamese would have to cease trying to overthrow the government of south vietnam.in <year> , rostow first advocated invading north vietnam , arguing for american and south vietnamese landings on the coast of north vietnam as the prelude for <unk> vietnam under the saigon government . in a policy paper addressed to the assistant secretary of state for asian affairs , w. averell harriman , dated <integer> <month> <year> , that began with the sentence : `` before you decide your old and <unk> friend has gone off his <unk> ... '' , rostow advocated invading north vietnam . as the approach of u.s. troops to the yalu river in <year> led to the chinese intervention in the korean war , it was generally accepted within washington that invading north vietnam would likewise lead to a war with china . for this reason , harriman was not impressed with rostow 's paper and advised kennedy to send rostow back to his <unk> in academia , saying that rostow was far too <unk> about the possibility of a nuclear war with china . the chinese nuclear program was well advanced by <year> , and in <year> china exploded its first atomic bomb , followed by its first <unk> bomb in <year>. rostow <unk> this consideration in paper addressed in <month> <year> , stating it would be best to invade north vietnam before the chinese `` blow a nuclear device '' . harriman was one of the richest men in the united states , who was very generous in <unk> to the democratic party , and as such served as a friend and adviser to every democratic president from roosevelt to johnson . the persistence which rostow advocated invading north vietnam even after the first chinese nuclear test in <year> worried harriman , and he consistently sought to club rostow 's influence , making him into one of rostow 's main enemies in <unk> kennedy 's assassination , his successor lyndon b. johnson promoted rostow to bundy 's job after he wrote johnson 's first state of the union speech . kennedy had generally ignored rostow 's advice , but johnson started to pay attention to him after he wrote a paper in <month> <year> stating a strategic bombing campaign against north vietnam would be enough to win the war . when the american ambassador to laos , william h. sullivan , wrote in <month> <year> he did not believe a strategic bombing would be decisive as the viet cong had a `` sustaining strength of their own '' , rostow was <unk> , arguing the viet cong had no real basis of support in south vietnam and only existed because north vietnam was supporting them . the idea that communism had an appeal to least some of south vietnam 's people was <unk> to rostow , who insisted that there was no civil war in south vietnam and there was only a struggle between north vietnam vs. south vietnam . the papers rostow wrote urged a policy of `` graduated '' pressure as the united states would steadily increase the level of bombing to such a point that it would ultimately lead to the destruction of north vietnam 's <unk> industry . unlike most american decision-makers , who knew nothing of vietnam 's history , rostow had done much reading on the subject , and had learned that over the centuries that chinese elites considered vietnam a lost province which they would one day <unk> ( vietnam had been a chinese province from <integer> bc to <integer> ad ) , leading to a long series of <unk> wars as successive vietnamese emperors fought off attempts by the emperors of china to incorporate vietnam into the middle kingdom . knowing of the full depth of the <unk> <unk> , rostow reached the conclusion that ho chi minh would not want his nation to draw too close to china , and as such , could not risk the destruction of north vietnam 's industry , which would leave north vietnam entirely dependent upon china . one of rostow 's opponents , george ball , argued that ho 's vietnamese nationalism would make him an asian version of josip broz tito of yugoslavia , a communist leader who wanted his nation to be independent of both moscow and beijing . ball argued that south vietnam was a poor and politically unstable ally that contributed little to american national security , and allowing ho to <unk> vietnam would pose no danger to the united states . rostow , by contrast , argued that south vietnam was the crucial to american national security and to allow the first `` domino '' to fall would cause the other `` dominoes '' in southeast asia ; in his mind , losing any nation to communism , even it was of the <unk> type was <unk> in <month> <year> , rostow championed the idea of congress giving president johnson the power to wage war in southeast asia , an idea that he first suggested in <month> <year>. rostow pointed out in a memo to the president that the degree of escalation in the vietnam war envisioned by the administration would pose constitutional and legal problems as the constitution gave congress , not the president , the right to declare war and the level of escalation envisioned would be a war in everything , but name . rostow ' solution to this problem was for congress to pass a resolution giving the president the legal power to essentially wage a war in <unk> congress passed the gulf of tonkin resolution on <integer> <month> <year> , which was the closest thing to a declaration of war that the united states had in vietnam , rostow was well pleased . about the gulf of tonkin incident that led to the resolution , rostow later said : `` we do n't know what happened , but it had the desired effect '' . in <month> <year> , rostow advised johnson to commit u.s. ground forces to vietnam to prove that `` we are prepared to face down any form of escalation '' and to send `` massive '' naval and air forces to strike north vietnam and if necessary , china as well . in a memo to johnson , rostow wrote : `` they [ the vietnamese communists ] will not actually accept a <unk> until they are sure that we mean it '' and needed to know that `` they now <unk> a <unk> who has made up his mind '' .in the <year> election , the republican candidate , senator barry goldwater , ran on a platform promising an aggressive foreign policy that would achieve a `` total victory '' over communism ( by which goldwater presumably meant the soviet union and china ) . by contrast , johnson sought to portray himself as just as `` tough on communism '' as goldwater while also portraying his opponent as a right-wing <unk> who was likely to cause a nuclear war . the republican slogan `` in your heart you know he 's right '' was <unk> <unk> by the democrats with the <unk> `` in your <unk> you know he 's <unk> ! '' in the context of the <year> election , johnson found the idea of a gradual process of escalating american involvement in vietnam appealing as it allowed him to present both as a `` tough '' president while also less extreme than goldwater . rostow 's consistent advocacy of a strategic bombing against north vietnam as the decisive way to win the war <unk> him to johnson as it promised a `` cheap '' victory that would not cost too many american lives . the national security adviser johnson had inherited from kennedy , mcgeorge bundy , greatly <unk> the president as he spoke with an <unk> new england accent that johnson found <unk> . when bundy developed doubts about the vietnam war in early <year> , johnson sacked him . == national security advisor == as national security advisor , rostow was responsible for developing the government 's policy in vietnam , and was convinced that the war could be won , becoming johnson 's main war hawk and playing an important role in bringing johnson 's presidency to an end . rostow was extremely close to johnson , later <unk> : <unk> took me into his house as well as his staff , into his family ; took my family in as well . it was an <unk> , human relationship . i came to hold the greatest possible <unk> for him , love for him , as well as respect for the job . i had an enormous compassion for what he was bearing during those years , for what the family was bearing . at the time the appointment of rostow as national security advisor was well received with almost all of the american media praising johnson for <unk> such an eminent economist and historian to advise him . in an editorial the new york times wrote that rostow was : a scholar with an original mind as well as an experienced official and policy planner ... one of the architects of john f. kennedy 's foreign policy ... mr. rostow , of course , will be only one of the president 's principal advisers , and mr. johnson will make his own decisions . but the appointment places <unk> the president an independent and cultivated mind that , as in the bundy era , should <unk> comprehension both of the <unk> of world problems and of the options among which the white house must choose . no president could ask for more . johnson stated at the time that : `` i 'm getting walt rostow as my intellectual . he 's not your intellectual . he 's not bundy 's intellectual . he 's not schlesinger 's intellectual . he 's not galbraith 's intellectual . he 's going to be my <unk> intellectual ! '' johnson because of his origins as a man from the impoverished , harsh world of texas who spoke his english with a heavy texas <unk> and who had rather <unk> <unk> always felt a certain sense of <unk> when dealing with <unk> <unk> league intellectuals like mcgeorge bundy , arthur schlesinger and john kenneth galbraith , who all served under kennedy . kennedy and his closest advisers always regarded johnson as `` white <unk> '' from texas , a <unk> man whose company had to be endured rather than enjoyed . johnson felt that rostow 's status as a jewish intellectual from new york who likewise worked his way up from poverty made him into a <unk> soul in a way that `` kennedy 's intellectuals '' never could be for him . one of johnson 's favorite advisers , jack <unk> , recommended rostow to the <unk> 's background growing up poor on a farm in texas left him with a sympathy for the <unk> , and he was very interested in rostow 's plans for third world development . rostow later recalled about johnson : `` he was always for the <unk> '' . through johnson believed that africa was a hopeless disaster , he had great hopes for developing latin america and asia , remembering how the new deal infrastructure projects of the <year>s had transformed texas , until then a very backward state . as rostow 's specialization was the subject of the economic modernization of the third world , his area of expertise appealed to the president , who often talked <unk> of his plans to bring electricity to the rural areas of south vietnam as the necessary prelude to ending poverty in south vietnam . finally , rostow 's consistently optimistic appraisal of the vietnam war appealed to johnson while his reputation as a <unk> was meant to signal that johnson was prepared to do whatever it took to win the war . the <unk> johnson , who was notorious within washington for <unk> his staff , `` initiated '' rostow by <unk> him by first <unk> news of his appointment to the press , and then calling up to accuse him of being the leak . after <unk> a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> at him , the president <unk> up the phone without giving rostow a chance to reply . johnson always `` initiated '' his staff by <unk> them in some way to <unk> his dominance , and rostow seems not to have taken it <unk> consistently argued to johnson that any effort at a peaceful resolution to the vietnam war would be `` <unk> '' . in his reports to johnson , rostow always put the emphasis on information that portrayed the united states as winning , becoming johnson 's favourite adviser on foreign affairs . the optimistic reports that the hawkish rostow wrote were much preferred by the president to the more <unk> reports written by the `` doves '' in the administration . a typical memo from rostow on <integer> <month> <year> read : `` mr. president , you can <unk> it all over . hanoi 's operation , backed by the <unk> [ chinese communists ] , is no longer being regarded as the wave of the future out there . u.s. power is beginning to be felt '' . the <unk> w. averell harriman called rostow `` america 's rasputin '' as he considered him to have a <unk> power over johnson 's mind , as he always pressed the president to take a harder line on vietnam against the advice of his more <unk> staff , harriman included . johnson was not enthusiastic about the vietnam war , later telling his biographer doris kearns in a very <unk> language that the great society was `` the woman i really loved '' while the vietnam war was `` that <unk> of a war on the other side of the world '' . as a president , johnson had often in private complained that he much rather focus on his `` great society '' program intended to end poverty and racism in america and that the vietnam war was an <unk> <unk> . given these views , harriman found it <unk> that johnson should <unk> his advice about finding a way for the united states to <unk> <unk> vietnam while accepting the counsel of rostow . johnson remembered how the `` loss of china '' in <year> had badly <unk> the democratic administration of harry s. truman who was <unk> by the republicans as `` soft on communism '' and <unk> <unk> in allowing the `` loss of china '' , attacks that <unk> with the american people at the time . johnson once told a reporter joseph <unk> , in an `` off-the-record '' conversation : i knew that harry truman and dean acheson had lost their effectiveness from the day the communists took over china . i believe that the loss of china had played a large role in the rise of joe mccarthy . and i knew that all these problems , taken together , were <unk> compared with what might happen if we lost vietnam ... i do n't give a damn about these little <unk> on the campuses , they 're just <unk> their <unk> and <unk> because they do n't want to fight . the great black <unk> for us is the right wing . if we do n't give this war over soon they 'll put enormous pressure on us to turn it into an <unk> and wreck all our other programs . johnson was fearful that if he allowed the `` loss of vietnam '' , it would cause a similar right-wing backlash that would allow a `` reactionary '' republican to win the presidency and for the <unk> to take control of congress , and together they would end his great society program along with the rest of johnson 's civil rights legislation . much of rostow 's influence on johnson was due to his insistence that to protect his domestic achievements that johnson had to fight the vietnam war , and moreover that the war was <unk> <unk> provided that the correct policies were followed . for johnson , rostow offered him a way out of an <unk> situation of fighting a war in vietnam that he rather not fight to protect the great society by promising him what rostow insisted was a path to victory , as rostow noted that presidents who win wars were usually also popular <unk> particular , rostow <unk> argued to the president that a programme of sustained bombing would force north vietnam to cease its support of the viet cong and thus win the war . rostow believed that strategic bombing alone would be enough to force north vietnam to <unk> , and became the main advocate in the white house of operation rolling thunder , the bombing offensive launched against north vietnam in <month> <year>. initially , rostow believed in only bombing certain targets as a way of warning hanoi to cease supporting the viet cong , but he changed his mind , coming to favour an <unk> bombing offensive that would completely destroy the economy of north vietnam . reflecting the lessons of the oil plan , rostow in particular believed that the destruction of the north vietnamese oil shortage facilities and the hydroelectric grid would so economically <unk> north vietnam that the war would be won , and he pressed johnson to end the restrictions on bombing oil shortage tanks and <unk> plants . rostow was opposed by harriman , who like him had spent much of world war ii living in england ; however , harriman had first-hand observed how german bombing of british cities had <unk> the will of the british public , and he now argued that american bombing on north vietnam was having the same effect on the north vietnamese public . the fact that rostow had arrived in london in fall of <year> , when the worse of the german bombing was over , while harriman as a special <unk> for president roosevelt had witnessed first-hand the `` <unk> '' against london and other british cities in the winter of <unk> contributed to their differing assessments of the effects of bombing . based on his experiences in wartime , harriman called the rostow thesis `` the <unk> without the <unk> '' .the first crisis that <unk> johnson and rostow was the buddhist uprising in south vietnam where an attempt by air marshal nguyễn cao kỳ to dismiss general nguyễn <unk> thi led to a civil war within the civil war as units of the south vietnamese army fought one another , much to the <unk> of johnson who could not believe that america 's allies in south vietnam were fighting each other . rostow for his part advised the president to fully support kỳ , charging that the buddhist struggle movement which had <unk> behind thi was being used by the communists . rostow told johnson : `` we are faced with the classic revolutionary <unk> paris in <year> and st. petersburg in <year> '' . rostow claimed that the <unk> were just being used by the viet cong just as lenin used <unk> to take power in <year> , but fortunately american forces were there to save the day . rostow concluded : `` in the face of defeat in the field and <unk> 's <unk> , lenin took over in <month> . this is about what would happen in saigon if we were not there , but we are there '' . as the civil war within the civil war between kỳ and thi greatly disturbed johnson , rostow 's advice to side with kỳ was decisive . the fact that kỳ expressed much <unk> for hitler , who in his own words was his `` only hero '' apparently did not <unk> rostow . one of rostow 's <unk> later wrote `` rostow was like rasputin to a <unk> under siege '' . rostow 's opponent , george ball wrote about rostow 's influence : `` he played to johnson 's weaker side , always creating an image of johnson standing against the forces of evil . he used to tell him how lincoln was abused by <unk> when he was at a certain stage of the civil war ... he spent a great deal of time creating a kind of <unk> for the president '' . in <month> <year> , harriman warned rostow against escalating the war to the brink of a nuclear war with china to best preserve life on plant earth , only to be told `` it is only in extreme crises that such settlements will come '' <unk> one point in <unk> , the hawkish rostow advocated that the united states invade north vietnam , even if it meant war with china , a course of action that mcnamara rejected as likely to cause a nuclear war . rostow always maintained that had his advice to the president to invade north vietnam been taken in <year> or <year> , the war would have been won , telling karnow in an interview in <year> that he was disappointed that johnson rejected his advice to invade north vietnam . johnson remembered how the approach of american forces upon the yalu river in <year> to china intervening in the korean war , and he was very fearful that an american invasion of north vietnam would once again led to a war with china , which now had nuclear weapons . for this reason , johnson was always against invading north vietnam as the risks of a nuclear war with china were too <unk> for him to consider . through rostow was disappointed that johnson rejected his advice to invade north vietnam , he knew better than to <unk> press that idea as that would <unk> the president , and instead he brought up the idea of invading north vietnam every so often a couple of months after johnson last rejected it . rostow also chaired a secret `` psychological strategy committee '' whose purpose was to supply `` correct facts '' about the vietnam war to congress , the media and the american people in <unk> <month> <year> , <unk> lewandowski , the polish delegate to the international control commission , which was supposed to police the geneva <unk> of <year> , contacted giovanni <unk> , the italian ambassador to south vietnam with a peace offer . lewandowski stated he just <unk> with ho chi minh , whom he claimed wanted a `` political compromise '' to end the war and would go `` quite a long way '' for such a settlement . lewandowski reported that ho was willing to drop his demand that the government of south vietnam be overthrown , though he preferred that <unk> else other than air marshal <unk> cao <unk> serve as premier ; asked only the national liberation front ( better known as the viet cong ) `` take part '' in negotiations , instead of serving in the government ; and were willing to accept a `` reasonable <unk> '' for the withdrawal of american forces instead demanding their immediate <unk> . the <unk> harriman and his deputy , the former cia agent chester cooper , were intrigued by the polish offer , which was backed by the soviet union . ever since <year> , mao zedong had been accusing the soviet union of <unk> to capitalism and abandoning its <unk> , and a sino-soviet competition had broken out about which of the two states was most willing to support north vietnam . lewandowski stated that the soviets were tired of this economically <unk> competition because every time china increased its support for north vietnam , the soviets had to increase their support on an even greater scale just to rebut the chinese claim that they were `` selling out '' <unk> was able to arrange for lewandowski to meet henry <unk> lodge jr , the u.s. ambassador in saigon , and the talks went well . by <month> <year> , it was arranged that john <unk> , the american ambassador in warsaw , would meet with north vietnamese diplomats the next month for peace talks in what was code-named operation <unk> . by <month> <year> , american aircraft bombed oil facilities and railroad <unk> in hanoi , which led the <unk> to <unk> if the u.s. continued to bomb hanoi , the talks would be <unk> . rostow told the president that he believed that operation <unk> was a `` trap '' and the north vietnamese demand that hanoi not be bombed <unk> showed the bombing campaign was indeed working as he promised it would . on <month> <integer> , <year> , johnson refused harriman 's request to cease bombing hanoi and a week later , the planned talks in warsaw were cancelled as the north vietnamese announced that there would be no peace talks as long as north vietnam was being bombed . in <month> <year> , rostow reported to johnson that the viet cong were `` <unk> '' under the american pressure , writing <unk> that the major problem for the americans in the coming year would be to find the best way to integrate those viet cong guerrillas who had surrendered back into civilian life . in a further <unk> sign he reported to the president in the same month that the bloody chaos of the cultural revolution had pushed china to the brink of civil war as `` mao 's own prestige has been seriously , perhaps <unk> , <unk> in this yet <unk> <unk> '' . with china collapsing into chaos , he believed that the chinese would be limited in their ability to support north vietnam for some time to come . in fact , mao continued to support north vietnam during the war with the war serving as a foreign policy counterpart to the cultural revolution as the `` great <unk> '' believed that extreme violence was necessary to maintain communist `` <unk> '' . the fact that some of mao 's targets in the cultural revolution such as liu <unk> and deng xiaoping were opposed to increased aid to north vietnam , preferring that the money be spent on chinese development instead , gave him an additional reason to support north vietnam.in <month> <year> , the israeli defense force <unk> the village of <unk> ' in jordan , a move which angered rostow as he told the israeli ambassador abba <unk> that king <unk> of jordan was an american ally and johnson very strongly <unk> of the raid . rostow stated : `` israel for some <unk> reason , wanted a leftist regime on the left bank [ of jordan ] so that it could then have a polarized situation in which the russians would be backing the arabs and the u.s. backing israel , and that israel would not be in an <unk> position where one of its friends among the great power would also be a friend of an arab country '' .in <month> <year> , the soviet premier alexei kosygin visited london , and the british prime minister harold wilson tried to act as a <unk> to end the vietnam war , offering to serve as an honest broker . wilson had been asked in <year> to send a british contingent to fight in vietnam , but as his labour party was stoutly opposed to britain fighting in vietnam , he had refused , a move that the normally <unk> secretary of state dean rusk called a `` <unk> '' . to end a running <unk> in <unk> relations as wilson was caught between the americans who were pressuring him to send british forces to vietnam and his own party who were pressuring not to , the prime minister was keen to end the vietnam war . kosygin told wilson that soviet influence in north vietnam was limited as the north vietnamese sought to play the soviet union off against china , but if the americans were willing to cease their bombing of north vietnam , the soviet government would indeed pressure ho chi minh to open peace talks . speaking on what he thought was a secure telephone line from the soviet embassy in london to the kremlin , kosygin told the soviet leader leonid brezhnev that there was a `` great opportunity for peace '' , through in the same call he admitted that the militant , <unk> line taken by china would pose problems . unknown to kosygin , mi5 had tapped the telephone line and a translated transcript of his call to brezhnev was <unk> to wilson . the transcript convinced wilson that kosygin was negotiating in good faith , and the prime minister then contracted the americans . american decision-makers tended to <unk> soviet influence over north vietnam , and wilson 's message that kosygin was willing to apply pressure on north vietnam was seen by johnson as potentially opening the door for peace . johnson directed david k. e. bruce , the u.s. ambassador to the court of st. james together with harriman 's deputy chester cooper to work alongside wilson in what was code-named operation sunflower . rostow <unk> johnson of wilson 's `` <unk> '' in not sending british forces to vietnam and advised the president not to trust him . rostow was extremely negative about operation sunflower , called wilson a <unk> and <unk> man who was working to end the vietnam war on terms unfavorable to the united states , and did his best to fan johnson 's already strong dislike of wilson . johnson only approved of operation sunflower because it would be too politically <unk> to turn an opportunity <unk> closely with bruce and cooper , wilson presented a ceasefire offer to kosygin on <integer> <month> <year> on behalf of the united states , which kosygin promised would be passed on to ho . a few hours later , cooper left his hotel to attend a performance of <unk> on the <unk> while <unk> the hotel staff that he would be at the theater if any phone calls came in for him . cooper was at the theater when he an <unk> told him that there was an urgent call from washington , saying that a mr. rostow wanted to speak with him at once . in his telephone call , rostow attacked cooper for the <unk> tone of wilson 's letter , which he called <unk> , and demanding it be rewritten to make it much tougher , a gesture that cooper felt was meant to sabotage operation sunflower . as demanded by rostow , a new letter with considerably more <unk> tone was given to kosygin , which led him to accuse the british and americans of negotiating in bad <unk> in a telephone call to johnson complained that the letter as rewritten by rostow had <unk> the peace talks and caused `` a hell of a situation '' . wilson charged that kosygin had taken a major risk for peace in vietnam that could have exposed him to criticism within the politburo and certainly would have exposed him to criticism from the chinese who constantly accused the soviets of not doing enough to support north vietnam , and he felt an opportunity for peace had been <unk> <unk> . <unk> to salvage something from operation sunflower , wilson , bruce and cooper put forward a new offer to kosygin on <integer> <month> that the united states would cease the bombing of north vietnam in exchange for no more north vietnamese troops going down the ho chi minh trail . johnson added in the condition that north vietnam had to respond to the offer by noon the next day , a deadline that bruce called `` <unk> '' and kosygin left london the next day with nothing to show for his <unk> <unk> blamed rostow for the failure of operation sunflower , telling his foreign secretary george brown : `` i suspect that rostow himself was largely responsible for the <unk> during the kosygin visit and <month> well have reported to the president in the light of responsibility '' . karnow wrote it is no means certain that wilson 's claim that a `` historic opportunity '' to end the war in vietnam in <year> had been <unk> as all kosygin was promising was to pressure ho to accept a ceasefire and as he himself noted that when the soviets <unk> the north vietnamese to do something that they did not want to do , they just drew closer to china . soviet pressure on north vietnam tended to most effective in conjugation with china , and in <year> the chinese were attacking the soviets in the most violent terms , accusing them of abandoning true communism , making any possibility of sino-soviet pressure on north vietnam most unlikely . karnow wrote at most operation sunflower offered was a chance to begin negotiations to end the war , and johnson and rostow shunned that <unk> <integer> <month> <year> , general william westmoreland asked for another <integer> , <integer> troops for south vietnam , a request that was supported by rostow . rostow went further than westmoreland by asking johnson to invade north vietnam , saying that the american people wanted their president `` do something big and <unk> decisive rather than small '' . at the meeting of the national security council , rostow <unk> by and fourth before a map of vietnam with a <unk> , showing the best way to invade while the defense secretary , robert mcnamara , countered him point by point , stating that the dangers of chinese intervention were far too great . rostow was so disappointed that johnson was more influenced by mcnamara than himself that he almost resigned in protest , before deciding as he put it to `` stay with johnson until the last day , while steadily , but quietly opposed to the way the war was being fought '' .in <month> <year> , the civil rights leader martin <unk> king jr. came out against the vietnam war with a speech in new york denouncing the `` immoral war '' whose burden he charged fall <unk> heavily on black men who more likely to be drafted to fight in vietnam . king 's speech increased the sense of siege in the white house , and hence rostow 's influence . in <month> <year> , allegations of police brutality led to race riots in detroit and newark . in response to the race riots , conservative republicans and democrats accused the johnson administration 's civil rights reforms as being the <unk> reason for the riots . johnson ordered rostow to collect `` such evidence as there is on external involvement in the violent radical community of the <unk> community in the u.s '' . johnson was apparently hoping that rostow would find evidence that the soviet union and/or china were behind the riots in detroit and newark , but his national security adviser was unable to produce any such evidence . the fact that rostow was ordered to investigate an essentially domestic matter showed that the president thought very highly of him . as the anti-war protests increased , rostow was able to reassure johnson that history will <unk> him , leading the president to remark he was `` a man of conviction who does n't try to play president '' .rostow was finally able to persuade johnson in <month> <year> to bomb north vietnamese oil shortage facilities and hydroelectric plants , predicating this would cause the collapse of north vietnam 's economy and win the war . by contrast , mcnamara reported to the president in the summer of <year> that even though american bombers by destroying hydroelectric plants had reduced north vietnam 's capacity to generate electricity by <integer> % , it had failed to impact <unk> on the war . mcnamara argued to johnson that rostow did not understand the differences between germany , an advanced , industrialized first world nation vs. north vietnam , a backward , rural third nation nation , and that <unk> that north vietnam 's very backwardness was a form of strength . mcnamara noted that even before the american bombing , the total annual hydroelectric production of north vietnam amounted only to a fifth of the annual hydroelectric production produced by the <unk> electric power company 's plant in alexandria , virginia . for this reason , mcnamara stated that <unk> out north vietnam 's hydroelectric plants did not have the same catastrophic effect on the north vietnamese economy that <unk> out america 's hydroelectric plants would have had on the american economy . likewise , north vietnam imported all of its oil from the soviet union , and the north vietnamese <unk> <unk> of oil from soviet <unk> at sea to <unk> , which then entered north vietnam via that country 's intricate network of rivers and <unk> . for this reason , the destruction of north vietnam 's oil shortage tanks by american bombers in <year> did not affect north vietnam 's capacity to wage war . the north vietnamese developed a system of hiding the oil <unk> underground all across the country . despite all of the <unk> caused by the american bombing between <year> and <year> with ports destroyed and oil shortage tanks left <unk> , north vietnam doubled its imports of soviet oil , reaching an annual total of <decimal> million tons by <year>. the north vietnamese built some <integer> , <integer> miles of tunnels and underground storage areas during the war to escape the bombing . rostow believed that the bombing tied down north vietnamese men who might otherwise fight in the war by forcing them to engage in reconstruction work , but the north vietnamese government had proclaimed a `` total war '' , <unk> the entire population for the war , and put women to work <unk> the damage done by american bombers . additionally , some <integer> , <integer> chinese soldiers served in north vietnam between <year>–68 to operate anti-aircraft guns and the <unk> ( surface to air missiles ) while rebuilding roads and <unk> working as national security advisor , rostow became involved in setting the united states ' posture towards israel . concerns about israel 's nuclear program were tabled by the united states during the <unk> to the six-day war and its aftermath . although he supported military and economic assistance to israel , rostow believed that increased public <unk> between the two states could run counter to us diplomatic and oil interests in the region . rostow considered president <unk> <unk> nasser of egypt to be a <unk> force who through he talked <unk> of war , in fact kept the arab-israeli dispute `` in the <unk> '' . rostow wrote in a memo advocating american economic aid to egypt : `` while no one likes the idea of paying off a <unk> , nasser is still the most powerful figure in the middle east ... and has <unk> <unk> arabs who have for a disastrous arab-israeli <unk> '' . after reviewing the <month> <year> report from the atomic energy commission team that had <unk> <unk> along with other intelligence , rostow informed president johnson that , though the team found no evidence of a nuclear weapons program , `` there are enough <unk> questions to make us want to avoid getting <unk> in too closely with israel . when egypt <unk> the <unk> in <month> <year> , rostow did not support an israeli strike against egypt , instead writing `` we <unk> with eshkol 's need to stop these [ palestinian ] raids and <unk> admit that a limited attack on syria <month> be his only answer '' . about the egyptian <unk> , rostow wrote that goals of american policy must be `` ( a ) prevent israel from being destroyed ( b ) stop aggression , and ( c ) to keep u <unk> out in front and <unk> his <unk> '' . in this regard , rostow wrote it was essential to persuade the israeli prime minister levi eshkol `` not to put a match to this <unk> '' . on <integer> <month> <year> , nasser further escalated the crisis by closing the straits of tiran to israeli shipping , which was a <unk> as israel had always stated that they would go to war to keep the straits of tiran <unk> the israelis claimed that eisenhower had given israel a security `` guarantee '' in <year> to keep open the straits of tiran , a claim that <unk> the americans who had never heard of this `` guarantee '' , rostow was tasked by johnson to investigate . the answer was soon found ; eisenhower had written a letter to the israeli prime minister david ben-gurion in <year> committing the united states to `` guarantee '' that the straits of tiran would be kept open to israeli shipping by the united states . rostow had to inform the israelis that only treaties ratified by congress are <unk> on the united states , and presidential <unk> represent only a moral , not a legal commitment on the part of the united states . however , he was later to state : `` from the moment eisenhower made clear that a commitment had been made , johnson had no doubt that he had to reopen the straits '' . rostow backed the regatta plan under which a group of various nations would <unk> their ships through the <unk> of tiran as a show of support for israel . rostow believed that the free passage of israeli ships via the straits of tiran was a `` <unk> principle '' the united states should uphold even it meant a war with egypt . as more and more nations backed out of the regatta plan , rostow came to take a more hawkish stance , saying to johnson that israel should move `` like a <unk> in high noon '' , using violence `` necessary to achieve not merely <unk> , but respect in the region '' . however , johnson did not favor war to resolve the crisis , but as he appeared to be <unk> from the regatta plan , eshkol wrote johnson a letter noting that he had not invaded egypt per american requests , but still the straits of tiran were closed to israeli shipping . johnson in his reply stated he only promised to use all of his constitutional powers to reopen the straits of tiran , noting that because of the vietnam war , he could not risk getting involving in another war at present , telling rostow to make that point clear to the israelis . rostow told the israeli <unk> ephraim evron sent to washington that johnson disliked the israeli `` pressure tactics '' and needed more time to study the issues . rostow informed evron : `` you have known president johnson for a long time and have a right to make your own assessment '' . evron <unk> that israel would probably go to war if nothing was done to reopen the straits of tiran , telling rostow that were `` about ten days '' of peace <unk> rostow , johnson , and secretary of state dean rusk tried to convince israel not to resort to military force , they supported israel once the war began . rostow told the egyptian ambassador , mustafa <unk> just before the war : `` your adversaries believe that a surprise attack by egypt and syria is <unk> . we know this is <unk> . we can not believe the government of the <unk> [ united arab republic ] would be so reckless . such a course would obviously have the most serious possible consequences '' . rostow added that israel had also been given a similar `` friendly warning '' not to <unk> . shortly before the war began , johnson asked rostow what he thought israel was going to do , leading rostow to reply `` they 're going to hit '' . at about <unk> am on <integer> <month> <year> , rostow <unk> johnson to tell him that israel had just attacked egypt with the israeli air force striking egyptian air force bases all over egypt . on the first day of the six day war , rostow submitted a report to johnson about the destruction of the egyptian air force that began : `` <unk> the account , with a map , of the first day 's turkey shoot '' . later that day , rostow in a memo to the president wrote `` we should begin ... talking with the russians and , if possible , with others about the terms of a settlement .... a ceasefire will not answer the fundamental questions in the minds of israelis until they have acquired so much real estate and destroyed so many egyptian planes and tanks that they are absolutely sure of their bargaining position '' <unk> the war began , rostow saw an opportunity for the united states , writing that the issue `` was whether the settlement of this war shall be on the basis of <unk> agreements , which leave the arabs in the posture of hostilities towards israel , keeping alive the israeli issue in arab political life as a unifying force , and <unk> the soviet union a handle on the arab world ; or whether a settlement <unk> in which israel is accepted as a middle eastern state '' . rostow believed that the possibility of israel gaining territory would allow a `` land for peace '' deal which might finally end the arab-israeli dispute , which led him to advocate no ceasefire to end the war until israel captured the <unk> heights from syria as he maintained the <unk> would never make peace until an initiative was provided . rostow favored having a peace plan calling for `` land for peace '' deal to be issued by the united nations , with the negotiations to be mediated by the united states . rostow made it clear that he did not <unk> israel permanently <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the west bank , east jerusalem , the <unk> heights and the <unk> , believing that an occupation would ensure that the arab-israeli conflict would never end . by the third day of the six day war , israeli officials were starting to <unk> that they were not willing to give up some of their recent territorial gains , especially east jerusalem . in <month> <year> , rostow advised johnson that with israel `` we lean against them just enough to keep their thinking from becoming too quickly set in the concrete of their current extended territorial <unk> '' . when the nuclear issue <unk> in <month> <year> , just prior to prime minister levi eshkol 's visit to the united states , rostow recommended that the president make it clear that the united states expected israel to sign the <unk> <month>–<month> <year> , operation pennsylvania peace initiative was launched , when a professor of political science at harvard , henry kissinger , got into contact with a french biologist , herbert <unk> , who in turns was friends with the resistance hero , raymond <unk> who was a friend of ho chi minh . <unk> and <unk> visited hanoi to meet ho to discuss peace . rostow was opposed to operation pennsylvania plan , and turn his best to turn johnson against it . under rostow 's influence , johnson sent a message to kissinger : `` i 'm going to give it one more try and if it does n't work i 'm going to come up to cambridge and cut off your balls ! '' kissinger contacted rostow to <unk> that the u.s pause the bombing to give operation pennsylvania a chance , only to be <unk> . kissinger was later to call rostow a `` <unk> '' .during the siege of khe <unk> in <month> <year> , rostow reported to president johnson that the north vietnamese were sending their forces to `` <unk> a new <unk> '' , predicating that khe <unk> would be the decisive battle in <year> and the united states must commit all of its forces to prevent the fall of khe <unk> . in this , rostow was playing into north vietnamese hands as the intention by hanoi was to draw away american forces from the main cities of south vietnam as the prelude for the tet offensive . during the tet offensive in <year> , rostow in a report stated that a <unk> attack against a remote village in south vietnam had been <unk> to <unk> with a debate in congress about <unk> for the war , leading karnow to <unk> write `` as if <unk> in hanoi consulted the congressional record before <unk> their units '' . during the tet offensive , rostow urged johnson to give a `` war leader speech '' in preference to a `` peace leader speech '' . in <month> <year> , rostow clashed repeatedly with the cia director , richard <unk> , who accused him of <unk> intelligence to present a more optimistic picture of the war than was <unk> the debate in washington in the aftermath of the tet offensive about whatever to send more troops to south vietnam or not , rostow argued that <unk> in vietnam was needed to deter `` aggression ... in the middle east , elsewhere in asia and perhaps even in europe '' and recommended that u.s ground forces enter north vietnam and laos to <unk> the ho chi minh trail . rostow urged johnson that `` it is time for a war leader speech instead of a <unk> speech '' . in the aftermath of the tet offensive , rostow argued that now was the time to finish off the vietnamese communists and urged johnson to send <integer> , <integer> more american troops to south vietnam to join the <unk> already there and to bomb north vietnam even harder . during the debates , the <unk> defense secretary robert mcnamara , who had been repeatedly <unk> in debates by rostow , snapped in <unk> : `` what then ? this <unk> bombing campaign , it 's worth nothing , it 's done nothing , they dropped more bombs than on all of europe in all of world war ii and it has n't done a fucking thing ! '' at that point , mcnamara , who had become disillusioned with the war he had once supported , broke down in tears , asking johnson <unk> to stop listening to rostow and saying the war could not be won . rostow had supported johnson 's decision to appoint clark clifford as defense secretary as he was known to be a hawk , and was greatly dis<month>ed when the new defense secretary turned out to be more of a <unk> than mcnamara <unk> was badly <unk> by his <unk> in the new hampshire democratic primary , which he won by only <integer> votes against the anti-war senator eugene mccarthy , a politician whom many people did not take seriously . even <unk> for johnson , inspired by this display of presidential weakness in new hampshire , senator robert f. kennedy , a politician whom many people did take seriously , entered the democratic primaries on an anti-war platform on <integer> <month> <year>. for the wisconsin democratic primary scheduled for <integer> <month> <year> , the polls in <month> <year> showed kennedy in the lead , mccarthy coming in second and johnson <unk> coming in third . faced with a situation where there was a real possibility of him losing the democratic nomination to be his party 's candidate in the <year> election , johnson decided to consider a political as opposed to a military solution to the vietnam war . clifford had despite expectations turned out to be more <unk> in office , and pressed the president to find an `` <unk> way out '' of vietnam . johnson sought the advice of the so-called `` wise men '' , a group of elder <unk> who advised him to find a way to end the war . the leader of the `` wise men '' , the former secretary of state dean acheson , told rostow `` tell the <unk> you tell him in precisely these <unk> he can take vietnam and <unk> it up his ass '' . on <integer> <month> , when johnson met the `` wise men '' , he was informed that `` we must take steps to <unk> '' . johnson 's highest level of education had been at the southwest texas teacher 's college , and throughout his life , he had much respect for those with university degrees from the `` eastern establishment '' . of the <integer> `` wise men '' , only general <unk> <unk> , supreme court justice <unk> <unk> , the diplomat robert <unk> and general maxwell taylor favored fighting on with the other ten <unk> <unk> the <year> election , rostow did his best to sabotage the peace talks going on paris as the american delegation led by his old enemy harriman negotiated with the north vietnamese in paris . by this point , rostow was <unk> with <unk> for harriman , and he missed an opportunity to <unk> to johnson . on <integer> <month> <year> , rostow that harriman should not head the american peace delegation to paris because `` he <unk> always <unk> understanding and sympathy with the south vietnamese '' . through johnson was sympathetic , he argued that harriman 's record as a distinguished diplomat going back to world war ii qualified him to head the delegation . rostow attached to the peace delegation a <unk> from the national security council , william <unk> , with orders `` to keep an eye on those <unk> and make sure that they did n't give away the family jewels '' .rostow changed his opinions to suit the president 's changed mood in the summer of <year> and now advised johnson to limit the bombing raids against north vietnam . by the time of the democratic convention in chicago in <month> <year> , rostow approved of the compromise campaign <unk> of the man who won the democratic nomination , vice president <unk> humphrey , which called for an end of the u.s. bombing of north vietnam , as by this point he feared that the republican candidate , richard nixon , would win the election . by <month> <year> , the democratic party was <unk> itself apart , divisions that were all too apparent at the democratic convention where anti-war and <unk> democrats <unk> debated on the convention floor about whatever the united states should continue fighting in vietnam or not . given the disarray in the democratic ranks , it was widely felt if the party did not find a way of unifying itself , nixon would win . when humphrey asked for rostow 's help with campaign <unk> , rostow came up with the <unk> `` we 're not going to let a <unk> of white and black <unk> turn this country over to wallace , <unk> thurmond , and those who base their campaigns on their support '' . by this , rostow meant that a divided democratic party might allow people like george wallace , the outspoken white <unk> former governor of alabama who was running for president as a <unk> candidate , or senator storm thurmond , a democrat who turned republican out of his opposition to civil rights for <unk> , would come to <unk> upon information provided by the national security agency , which broken the south vietnamese diplomatic codes , senior officials johnson administration had learned that anna <unk> , the <unk> of the republican women for nixon group had met the south vietnamese ambassador , <unk> diem , to tell him that south vietnam should sabotage paris peace talks to improve the chances of nixon winning the election . on <integer> <month> <year> , rostow told johnson he now had information `` on how certain republicans <month> have <unk> the south vietnamese to behave as they have been <unk> '' . rostow also advised johnson not to go public with this information , saying he should instead tell nixon in private to keep away from <unk> , advice which was taken . by the fall of <year> , rostow had come to feel that it was better if nixon won the election rather than the `` <unk> '' humphrey who on the campaign trail had become increasingly critical of the war . in one of his <unk> to johnson , rostow , who was still unhappy about johnson 's decision not to invade north vietnam , wrote he should say if asked about <unk> relations : `` generally speaking , the military has wanted us to use more power , earlier and faster . they <month> have been right . but the president had other considerations to think of '' . it was a mark of rostow 's influence that johnson , who was well known for being <unk> towards subordinates , did not explode in <unk> as he would have if anyone else wrote such a memo . == public intellectual == when richard nixon became president in <year> , rostow left office , and over the next thirty years taught economics at the lyndon b. johnson school of public affairs at the university of texas at austin with his wife <unk> rostow , who later became dean of the school . in <year> , he was told that because of his support for the vietnam war that he was not welcome to resume teaching at mit , forcing him to take up a position at the university of texas . by <year> the general consensus amongst the liberal american intelligentsia was that the vietnam war was a <unk> mistake of epic proportions and when rostow left government service in <month> <year> , he found himself an unpopular figure with the liberal intelligentsia , making it impossible for him to return to mit . rostow 's biographer , the british historian david milne , wrote : `` in <year> , rostow 's <unk> was such that none of america 's elite universities were willing to offer him a job '' . for a man who had previously held professorships at harvard , oxford , cambridge , and the mit , it was considered within academic circles to be a real <unk> for him to teach at the university of <unk> wrote extensively in defense of neoliberal economics , particularly in developing nations . rostow 's successor as national security adviser , the harvard professor , henry kissinger , was <unk> with the fear of becoming `` this administration 's walt rostow '' whose support for the vietnam war <unk> his reputation with the liberal sections of the american intelligentsia and led him teaching at the university of texas , which was regarded as a <unk> university , a fate that kissinger was keen to avoid . kissinger wanted to resume his professorship at harvard as he did not want to end up teaching at an `` unacceptable '' institution like the university of texas as rostow <unk> himself noted that the university of texas campus was <unk> as the texas government had used its oil wealth to create a <unk> , <unk> campus , but complained that the university administration was more interested in supporting the football team , the <unk> , than in research and teaching . from <year> to <year> , rostow served as one of the <unk> on johnson 's memoir , the vantage point , writing all of the chapters dealing with foreign affairs . as the teaching load at the university of texas was very light , rostow had much time for research and between <year> and <year> wrote <integer> books , mostly on world economic history with a particular focus on economic modernization . in his own memoir , the diffusion of power , rostow argued that for the justice of the vietnam war and <unk> out at kennedy for ignoring his advice in <year> to invade north vietnam , writing that this `` was the greatest single error of u.s foreign policy in the <year>s '' . reflecting his friendship with johnson , rostow was less harsh towards him in his memoir , but still he charged that johnson was too worried about the possibility of a nuclear war with china and should have taken his advice to invade north vietnam , arguing that the risk of a nuclear war with china was <unk> . the main <unk> in the diffusion of power was mcnamara , who rostow accused of being a <unk> from <year> onward , charging that it was his weakness and doubts about the war that caused johnson to hold back and not invade north vietnam.in the <year>s , rostow visited south korea , whose economy had greatly industrialized under the rule of general park . during his visit , rostow praised south korea as the best example of the theories he set out in the stages of economic growth , arguing that general park 's policies had indeed pushed south korea into an `` industrial take-off '' . in <year> , rostow told the south korean economist park <unk> that the experience of south korea proved the <unk> of the stages of economic growth and expressed the wish that more third world leaders had been like general park ; though the economist park noted that general park 's policy of five year plans did not reflect rostow 's <unk> <year> , a book by rostow the united states and the regional organization of asia and the pacific , <year>–1985 was published . in this book , rostow advanced the thesis that the united states had actually `` won '' the vietnam war , as he contended the war had `` brought time '' for the rest of south-east asia to economically advance and escape communism . rostow based his argument along the contention that based on the ways things were going in south vietnam in <year> that the country would have fallen to the communists that year , and the american intervention , which though it failed to save south vietnam in the end , gave an extra ten years to allow the rest of south-east asia to economically advance , ensuring that the other `` dominoes '' did not fall . rostow argued that the economic success of most of the members of the association of south-east asian nations , which comprised indonesia , malaysia , singapore , brunei , thailand and the philippines was due to the vietnam war `` buying time '' for them , as none of those nations ended up being communist and with the exception of the philippines , all of them were `` asian <unk> '' ( i.e . rapidly growing economies ) .in <year> , mcnamara published his memoir in retrospect when he famously declared about the vietnam war `` we were wrong , <unk> wrong '' . on <integer> <month> <year> in the times literacy supplement , rostow wrote a <unk> review of in retrospect under the title `` the case for the war '' , where he accused mcnamara of <unk> all of the families of americans who died in vietnam and argued that the united states had in fact `` won '' the vietnam war as the non-communist states of southeast asia `` had <unk> their real gnp between <year> and <year> '' , which rostow argued would not have happened had the united states not fought in vietnam . the review in the times literacy supplement reflected the intense feud between mcnamara and rostow ; the latter made much of the fact that mcnamara often suffered from depression and suggested that his `` <unk> '' was due to an <unk> mind . rostow believed that mcnamara had suffered a nervous breakdown in <year> and his `` <unk> '' about vietnam was due to the fact he had `` <unk> '' under the strain of war . milne wrote that it is indeed correct that mcnamara suffered from <unk> of depression , but there is nothing to support rostow 's claim he had lost his mind as defense secretary . milne also wrote that rostow 's assertion that high economic growth rates in southeast asia justified the vietnam war was <unk> towards the families of all the americans and vietnamese who died in the war . == honors and awards == rostow received the order of the british empire ( <year> ) ,
