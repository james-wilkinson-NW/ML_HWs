however , hours before he was due to sign the resulting agreement on behalf of the east german government , he committed suicide by <unk> . == life == === early years === erich hans apel was born in judenbach , a small town in the <unk> forest which had once benefited from its position as a <unk> post on a major trade route , but which had lost out <unk> following the construction of a railway line providing a direct link from leipzig to <unk> . apel 's father was a mechanical engineer : his mother worked in the <unk> industry . he attended school in nearby <unk> and <unk> , but left school in <year> in order to <unk> on an apprenticeship at the <unk> <unk> factory in <unk> and mechanical engineering . the ruling nazi party was popular in the region and in <year> he joined the <unk> <unk> youth organisation . however , it was found that the sixteen year old <unk> the `` <unk> <unk> drill exercises '' ( `` der <unk> drill '' ) , and he was <unk> out after nine months because of his `` negative attitude '' to the <unk> exercises in which the boys were expected to participate . after completing his apprenticeship in <year> he stayed on at the <unk> factory as a <unk> and designer till <year>. then , between <year> and <year> , he attended the engineering academy at nearby <unk> , emerging with a degree in mechanical engineering . === war years === directly after receiving his degree , in <month> <year> apel was conscripted into the army , becoming a member of infantry reserve battalion <integer> , based in <unk> . around this time world war ii broke out . however , on <integer> <month> <year> apel was ordered to the weapons agency 's research facility at peenemünde on germany 's northern coast . the head of the facility was the charismatic rocketry expert , <unk> von braun . apel seems to have been in his element . a contemporary later recalled that he worked from <decimal> till <decimal> , like everyone else , but then in the <unk> he <unk> to his <unk> in a nearby hostel , in order to work on proposals for improvements . his <unk> was the hydraulic systems for the rockets . he was <unk> in his work of calculation , measuring and modelling . he seems to have made a good impression , since in <month> <year> he was relieved of all further <unk> regarding military service . in <month> <year> he was appointed to the position of plant engineer and assistant to the facility director . he was totally <unk> in politics , never joining the party , and regarded by colleagues as a dedicated engineer , body and <unk> <month> <year> was apel 's <unk> birthday . <unk> , he was able to spent the day as a witness to the first launch anywhere in the world of a <unk> rocket , the so-called ( at this stage ) <unk> . the launch took place at <decimal> and everything worked <unk> , the rocket attaining a speed of mach <decimal> , a height of <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) , and a <unk> distance of <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) . at the start of <year> apel was promoted again , despite his young age becoming head of one of the many development departments at the peenemünde army research facility . shortly after this he mentioned to as group of colleagues what a <unk> business it was that the thing should explode in the middle of a city . his boss , walter <unk> , came to hear of the comment and called him aside , `` apel , you should have joined the medical service : you 're too soft for the work here '' . however , there is no <unk> that apel 's comment <unk> affected his career prospects : the researchers at peenemünde saw themselves as an elite team engaged in vital work , and the only realistic alternative career path would have led him back to the military <unk> <year> it became clear that the british knew about the research facility at peenemünde . with their us allies they launched a succession of bombing raids to destroy it , starting in <month> <year>. most of the <integer> people killed at peenemünde in the first bombing raid , on <integer> <month> , were forced labourers , but the dead also included erich apel 's boss , walter <unk> and his family . by that time , however , apel himself was far away , transferred in <month> <year> with his own team of assembly specialists and administrators to the <unk> ( lhw ) plant in breslau ( as <unk> was known ) before <year> ) . breslau was traditionally a centre for railway production and lhw was traditionally a manufacturer of railway <unk> and rolling stock , but during the war its sophisticated engineering capabilities were also being adapted to produce components and <unk> for the rocket , which government propaganda was by now identifying as the `` <unk> <integer> '' ( `` retribution weapon <integer> '' / v-2 ) . as the continuing bombing raids at the peenemünde army research center had their effect through <year> and <year> , the lhw plant became the assembly location for the v-2 rockets . in <integer> <month> <year> , at the request of the lhw management , erich apel was released from his employment contract with the army high command weapons agency . he was now employed directly as chief engineer and assistant to the technical director at <unk> the end of <year> the war was coming home to germany . lhw now <unk> v-2 rocket production to a firm called `` <unk> gmbh '' in <unk> near nordhausen . with the assembly contract they sent erich apel , who with effect from <month> <year> became technical director of <unk> gmbh . apel 's <unk> determination to avoid politics now seemed to catch up with him , since the new location for rocket assembly was part of the vast underground factory at the <unk> concentration camp . conditions were so <unk> that at least one commentator has suggested that the v-2 rockets found more victims among the <unk> labourers engaged in constructing the underground factory and in working on the rockets than among the citizens of london , the intended target of the finished rockets . even if erich apel had nothing to do with setting up and running the vast deadly forced labour infrastructure , as the engineer responsible for the rockets he was naturally associated with it . as nazi germany collapsed militarily and politically during the first part of <year> , apel succeeded in getting back to his home village of judenbach . like millions of his <unk> he was determined to make a clean break with the past . === soviet occupation zone === war ended , formally , in <month> <year>. the entire southern region of germany had been liberated by the united states army , but the victorious powers had already agreed a partition of the western two <unk> of the country into four military occupation zones . after the americans had withdrawn to their agreed positions judenbach was included in the middle portion of germany that would now be administered as the soviet occupation zone . initially apel worked on the local farms . on <integer> <month> <year> he enrolled on the `` new teachers '' programme . with millions of working age germans dead or in prison of war camps , there was a <unk> shortage of teachers , and the scheme , implemented with varying levels of effectiveness in the various occupation zones , was designed to select those <unk> educated individuals who were thought to be not <unk> <unk> by nazi involvement , to <unk> a rapid `` <unk> '' and set to work <unk> <unk> children . at the same time he both studied and taught , till <integer> <month> <year> , at the professional business academy in nearby <unk> <month> <year> erich apel joined a political party , choosing the centre-left social democratic party ( `` <unk> <unk> deutschlands '' / spd ) . four months later , the spd merged with the communist party to form the new socialist unity party ( `` sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands '' / sed ) . the merger was presented as a way to prevent divisions on the political left from opening up opportunities for right wing <unk> to take control as had happened after <year>. in reality it never took effect except in the soviet zone , where it received sustained practical backing from the military administration . the political development was not one for which apel could <unk> much enthusiasm , and in common with many spd members he was not one of those `` <unk> '' to sign his party membership over to the new party ( though he was accepted as a member of the sed , eleven years later , in <year> ) . === work in the soviet union === on <integer> <month> <year> apel was `` picked up '' by the soviet authorities . they showed no interest in his association with forced labour at the underground rocket factory at <unk> . but they were nevertheless interested in the factory ; and they did make him an offer which , for a range of practical reasons , he was almost certainly in no position to <unk> . the soviets invited him to work with them as chief engineer and representative of the ( former ) factory management at the soviet technical commission in the <unk> <unk> of nordhausen ( which had also ended up in the soviet zone ) , adjacent to the vast underground rocket <unk> interest in the german rocket programme was fully shared by the united states . during the chaotic closing weeks of the war <unk> von braun had traveled to nordhausen and met with apel , offering to take him to america after the military defeat which by now everyone saw as inevitable . von braun was keen , as far as possible , to keep his full team with him . but his specialist in rocket hydraulics turned him down . apel did not want to volunteer for further work in the weapons <unk> <integer> <month> <year> , across the soviet occupation zone , in the early hours of the morning <unk> and engineers from the rocket project were visited by soviet officers , each accompanied by a translator . a brief <unk> was read out : `` by order of the soviet military administration you must work for five years in the soviet union . you can take your wife and family with you , and as many of your personal effects as you wish ... '' . till now apel 's working life had involved living in guest houses or <unk> so he did not have many personal effects . just hours after the order was given apel and his colleagues were on the train heading east as part of operation <unk> . the mood on the train was dark and <unk> . the journey took around <integer> days . their ultimate <unk> was an island in the middle of lake <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> region some <integer> kilometres ( <integer> mi ) northwest of <unk> crossing to the island apel was taken to <unk> ( today korolyov ) where he was reunited with a large quantity of heavy machinery and equipment that he had last seen in germany during the closing weeks of the war . the german invasion of the soviet union in <year> had forced the soviets to build up an impressive expertise in <unk> factories and their equipment , <unk> them up , and <unk> them by train to places beyond the reach of the german army . after the war they had taken the opportunity to perfect their skills , <unk> up surviving german factories and their equipment , and taking them to the soviet union by way of war reparations . the <year> <unk> <unk> turned up in <year> as the soviet built <unk> <decimal> they had also applied their skill to the rocket facility in the mountain . the red army had used <integer> railway <unk> to carry away <unk> tonnes of machinery , munitions , and partially constructed rockets . by the end of <year> a further <unk> railway <unk> had transported another <unk> rocket construction plant , partially constructed rockets , and specialist machinery from the former nazi facility in the soviet occupation zone to a new rocket research facility in the soviet union . secrecy was so complete that ten years later the world still believed that soviet rocket programme was based on soviet rocket science . the americans had taken away only <integer> tonnes of `` rocket materials '' from the nordhausen facility . after <unk> the soviet <unk> , erich apel joined his colleagues on the island of <unk> the german workers on an island helped enforce the secrecy , but the german experts nevertheless received wages twice as high as those of their soviet counterparts . erich apel became head of a testing department . <unk> years later a colleague from those times remembered him as `` <unk> , but also a little distant . not so <unk> , and always a bit 'the boss ' '' ( `` '' <unk> war <unk> , <unk> auch ein <unk> <unk> . nicht so <unk> , <unk> auch ein <unk> <unk> chef ' '' ) . there was no attempt to integrate the germans into the soviet research teams . stalin never intended that they should remain permanently . the idea was to `` milk '' their knowledge till their soviet counterparts had absorbed all the necessary knowledge . that point was reached by the end of <year> , after which the germans on the island were restricted to `` theoretical '' research . that <unk> apel well enough . he had found a new wife , <unk> <unk> , the daughter of a german aircraft engineer from the <unk> aircraft <unk> , whom he married in <unk> . information on his first marriage remains in short supply : <unk> apel said later that she believed erich had married an austrian woman around <year> , but the first marriage had ended in divorce because apel 's war work meant he was almost always away . it was frequently indicated that during his six years in the soviet union erich apel became a communist , but in his bones it seems reasonable to conclude that he remained a political agnostic . === german democratic republic === erich apel returned on <integer> <month> <year>. the soviet occupation zone had been <unk> in <month> <year> as the soviet sponsored german democratic republic ( east germany ) . there was no call , in east germany , for specialist expertise in weapons and rocketry . other branches of heavy industry remained in place , however . just four months after getting back , erich apel was working as a chief engineer and department head at the east german ministry for machinery construction . promotion to a technical directorship followed in <month> <year>. in <month> <year> he became a deputy minister in the department , working under heinrich <unk> <unk> his rapid advancement in the new state to its leader , walter ulbricht . after years under military occupation which in many ways placed soviet well-being ahead of german reconstruction , ulbricht had narrowly survived the <year> uprising and was now keen to demonstrate that under soviet <unk> it was possible to create in east germany a fully functioning socialist state . for that he needed technical experts and talented administrators . apel was both . an important political ally and <unk> was fritz <unk> . after his six years in the soviet union , apel ( like <unk> ) , was a convinced proponent of a `` planned economy '' . the choice was one between `` <unk> '' ( <unk> ) and `` chaos '' . it was already apparent that in west germany free market capitalism was giving rise to far more rapid economic growth than anything happening in east germany . the lesson to be drawn was that economic planning had to be undertaken <unk> and in microscopic detail by the government . political leadership was <unk> <month> <year> , already a junior government minister , apel became a candidate for party membership . membership was granted in <month> <year>. slightly more than one year later , in <month> <year> , he became a candidate for central committee membership . in <month> <year> erich apel became one of approximately <integer> members of the powerful party central committee . under the <unk> constitutional structure in place , the central committee exercised a far <unk> degree of control than government ministers or the national parliament ( volkskammer ) . it was therefore by most <unk> a promotion when on <integer> <month> <year> erich apel resigned his ministerial position and accepted a position as head of the newly created economic commission of the central committee 's politburo . in <year> he also became a member of the volkskammer , in which capacity he chaired the parliamentary economic <unk> economic challenges facing east germany were already formidable by <year>. the mandate walter ulbricht gave to the new economic commission was summed up in the <unk> which the leader liked to repeat . east germany should `` <unk> without <unk> up '' ( `` <unk> <unk> <unk> '' ) . east germans must be able to eat more <unk> and meat than west germans . one day they must be able to travel in faster cars and live in better <unk> . this must be accomplished without having to copy `` capitalist production methods '' . erich apel must make it happen , not `` <unk> ... never '' , but by creating and following a plan . if it was a dream , it was a dream in which many comrades <unk> believed . in <month> <year> apel was promoted to candidate membership of the politburo and <unk> of the central committee . there were other appointments which combined to stress his importance in the wider government project . in <year> he received a doctorate in return for a dissertation on the so-called east german chemistry <unk> `` chemistry programme '' was a <unk> plan , launched in <year> under the widely communicated <unk> `` chemistry gives us bread , welfare and beauty '' ( `` <unk> <unk> <unk> ,

world markets , the nation continued to be dependent on <unk> of vital raw materials from the soviet union , and the partnership with the soviets , even at the height of the cold war , was far less

raw materials which the east german economic plan for <unk> called for . one solution was to try and select trading partners according to commercial criteria and not purely according to political

emerged a particularly intense mutual antagonism . to the extent that both men were responsible for delivering a better future for the people there was an <unk> <unk> between their public profiles . stoph never missed a chance to <unk> a failure to meet planned objectives or to <unk> apel 's actions and <unk> . pressure also increased from moscow where nikita khrushchev fell from power in <month> <year>. leonid brezhnev , the new party secretary in moscow , condemned his predecessor 's `` failures of economic leadership '' . there were a number of rapid practical changes . soviet wheat <unk> to east germany planned for <year> were cut back to <other>00,000 tonnes , a third of the annual quantity in existing plans . within the east german leadership apel had always been able to count on backing for his reforms from walter ulbricht , but the changes in moscow meant that ulbricht 's driving priority had was now to secure his own position . back in <month> <year> ulbricht had <unk> colleagues , under the influence of apel , announcing a <unk> <unk> on economic policy . `` we need economics to <unk> politics '' ( `` wir <unk> ein <unk> der <unk> über die <unk> !

yugoslavia ( <year>–1990 ) , prime minister of slovenia ( <year>–2002 , with a short break in <year> ) and president of slovenia ( <year>–2007 ) . == youth and early career == drnovšek was born in <unk> and was raised in the small town of <unk> in the <unk> of zagorje ob <unk> , where his father viktor ( <year>–2005 ) was the local mine chief and his mother silva ( <year>–1976 ) was a homemaker . drnovšek graduated from the university of ljubljana with a degree in economics in <year> . meanwhile , he worked as an <unk> at a le <unk> bank . in <year> , at the age of <integer> , he became chief financial officer at <unk> <unk> zagorje , a construction company . two years later he became , for one year , an economic adviser at the yugoslav embassy in cairo . he defended his master 's thesis in <year> , and in <year> , he defended his dissertation in <year> at the faculty of economics and business at the university of <unk> . in <year> , he became head of the local branch of ljubljana bank in his home region of the central <unk> valley in central slovenia . in <year> he was chosen to be a delegate at the slovenian republic assembly ( parliament ) and also the chamber of republics and provinces of the yugoslav parliament . == membership in the yugoslav presidency == in <year> , <unk> <unk> , the slovenian representative to the collective presidency of yugoslavia , retired . the slovenian communist party , aware of upcoming <unk> , decided to organize elections between two candidates for the position . drnovšek , until then rather unknown to the public , defeated <unk> <unk> , the party 's preferred candidate . the communist <unk> of other yugoslav republics did not agree with this new way of selecting the representative to the collective presidency , so the slovenian republic parliament had to confirm the result of the elections . drnovšek served as chairman of the collective presidency from <unk> . while he was chairman of the presidency , he was also chairman of the <unk> movement and the commander of the yugoslav people 's army . until the end of communist rule he was an active member of the communist party . after the democratic changes in slovenia , the country <unk> from yugoslavia . following the ten day war , drnovšek used his position in the collective presidency to help <unk> the <unk> agreement and to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal of yugoslav army from slovenia . == prime minister of slovenia == in <year> , after a government crisis in the <unk> coalition , which had won the first democratic elections in slovenia in <year> and led the country to independence , drnovšek became the second prime minister of independent slovenia . he was chosen as a compromise candidate and an expert in economic policy . his <unk> government was supported both by the left and <unk> wing of the dissolved <unk> coalition ( the social democratic party of slovenia , the democratic party and the <unk> of slovenia ) and by three parties that derived from organizations of the former communist regime ( the liberal democratic party , the party of democratic reform and the socialist party of slovenia ) . shortly afterwards , drnovšek was elected president of the liberal democratic party ( <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) , the legal successor of the association of socialist youth of slovenia ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) , the youth fraction of the communist party of slovenia . in <year> , the liberal democratic party under drnovšek 's leadership won the parliamentary elections , but due to a high <unk> of the popular vote had to ally itself with other parties in order to form a stable government . despite a politically turbulent mandate ( in <year> , the social democratic party of slovenia left the coalition ) , the party gained votes in <year> , remaining the largest party in the government . nevertheless , drnovšek barely secured himself a third term in office after a failed attempt to ally himself with the slovenian national party . in <year> , the liberal democracy of slovenia formed a coalition government with the populist slovenian people 's party which finally enabled drnovšek to serve a third term in office . he headed the government until <month> <year> , when he stepped down due to disagreements with the slovenian people 's party . after less than six months in opposition , drnovšek returned to power in the autumn of <year> , after his party gained a clear victory in the parliamentary elections . drnovšek 's governments guided slovenia 's political and economic reconstruction . he successfully <unk> the twin tasks of <unk> slovenia 's trade away from the <unk> of the old yugoslavia towards the west and replacing the ineffective <unk> business model with more <unk> mechanisms . unlike the other five former yugoslav republics which were run for much of the <year>s by frequently authoritarian presidents , slovenia under drnovšek 's premiership quickly emerged from the <unk> of the federation as a functioning parliamentary democracy . drnovšek 's political strategy was concentrated on broad coalitions , <unk> ideological and <unk> divisions between parties . contrary to some other former communist countries in eastern europe , the economic and social transformation in slovenia pursued by drnovšek 's governments followed a <unk> <unk> was a staunch supporter of slovenia 's entry in the european union and nato and was largely responsible for slovenia 's successful bid for membership in both of those organizations . as prime minister , he was frequently active on foreign policy issues . on <integer> <month> <year> , he helped to arrange the first meeting of the u.s. president george w. bush with the russian president vladimir putin , which was held in the upper <unk> estate of <unk> <unk> <unk> . ( <unk> <year> ) in <year> , he ran for president of slovenia , and was elected in the second round , defeating the <unk> candidate barbara <unk> . == president of slovenia and the change in lifestyle == drnovšek 's presidency was highly controversial . in the first three years in office , he rarely appeared in public , save for the most important official duties . in <year> , however , a change of style became visible . he launched several campaigns in foreign policy , such as a failed <unk> mission to darfur and a proposal for the solution of the political crisis in <unk> . on <month> <integer> , <year> , he left the liberal democracy of slovenia . shortly afterwards , he founded the movement for justice and development and became its first president . he claimed this was not meant to be a political movement , but rather a wide initiative , <unk> to `` raise human consciousness and make the world a better place '' . on <month> <integer> , <year> , he announced that he would not be running for a second term in an interview on tv slovenia . === conflict with the government === the <year> legislative election brought further changes and a political <unk> to the right . janez janša , the leader of a right-wing coalition , formed the new government . in slovenia , this was the first time after <year> that the president and the prime minister had represented opposing political factions for more than a few months . between <unk> , the relationship between president drnovšek and janez janša , then leader of the opposition , were considered more than good and in the first year of cohabitation , no major problems arose . in the beginning of his term , drnovšek , who was ill with kidney cancer , stayed out of public view . when he <unk> in late <year> he had already changed his lifestyle : he had become a <unk> ( though one of his colleagues in a televised interview mentioned their regular <dayofweek> visits to a <unk> in <unk> market , ljubljana ) , moved out of the capital into the countryside , and withdrew from party politics completely , ending his already frozen membership in the liberal democracy . drnovšek 's new approach to politics prompted one political commentator to nickname him `` slovenia 's gandhi '' .the relationship between drnovšek and the government quickly became <unk> . disagreements began with drnovšek 's initiatives in foreign politics , aimed at solving major foreign conflicts , including those in darfur and <unk> . initially , these initiatives were initially not openly opposed by the prime minister janez janša , but were criticized by the foreign minister <unk> <unk> , drnovšek 's former collaborator and close political ally until <unk> major clash between the two happened in summer <year> , when disagreement arose over drnovšek 's attempt to intervene in the darfur conflict . the disagreements moved from issues of domestic politics in <month> <year> , when drnovšek publicly criticised the treatment of the <unk> , a <unk> family whose neighborhood had forced them to <unk> , which in turn had subjected them to police supervision and <unk> of <unk> disagreements however escalated when the parliamentary majority repeatedly rejected president 's candidates for the governor of the bank of slovenia , beginning with the rejection of incumbent <unk> <unk> . the friction continued over the appointment of other state official <unk> , including constitutional court judges . although the president 's political support suffered after his personal transformation , the polls nevertheless showed public backing of the president against an increasingly unpopular <unk> <unk> reached its <unk> in <month> <year> , when the newly appointed director of the slovenian intelligence and security agency <unk> <unk> <unk> several documents from the period before <year> , revealing , among other , that drnovšek had used secret service funds for personal purposes between <unk> the president reacted with a harsh criticism of the government 's policies , accusing the ruling coalition of <unk> its power for personal <unk> and labeled the then current prime minister janez janša as `` the leader of the negative <unk> '' in the last months in office , drnovšek continued his attacks on prime minister janez janša , who mostly remained silent on the issue . drnovšek accused janša of `` <unk> <unk> tendencies '' . he became a <unk> ( janez d ) , signing his posts as `` janez d '' and expressing opinions on various issues from foreign policy , environmentalism , human relationships , religion , animal rights and personal growth . in his last months in office , he withdrew to a <unk> life again , <unk> his time to the movement for justice and development and the popularization of his lifestyle and views . === lifestyle changes === during his time in office as the president of slovenia , he wrote and published several books in spiritual philosophy , including misli o življenju

world . for example , he was present at the inauguration of <unk> <unk> , the first native american president of bolivia , and later hosted <unk> ethnic <unk> in the presidential palace in ljubljana . after his cancer diagnosis , drnovšek became a <unk> and claimed that this greatly improved his <unk> of his new lifestyle and the content of his books and <unk> , he was often regarded as an <unk> of

keeton earned a master 's degree at virginia polytechnic institute ( virginia tech ) , during which he revised the millipede genus <unk> . during his time at virginia tech , keeton met barbara <unk> , whom he married in <year>. he moved to cornell university in <year> in order to continue his research with millipede systematics for his doctorate , where he studied under dr. howard e. evans . his doctoral research culminated in a monograph on the family <unk> . he received his doctorate in <year> and joined the biology faculty at cornell university as a biology professor in <year> . keeton was a noted and well-known biological science <integer> professor beginning in <year> , so much so that his popularity as a professor earned his class the nickname of the `` keeton course '' . in addition to his teaching keeton is known for his work with pigeons and bird orientation and navigation , as he studied pigeon homing behaviors for well over a decade . during his early work at cornell university the biological science departments were reorganized , and as a result william keeton moved from the entomology department to the newly created neurobiology and behavior department . it was here where he first started his research on pigeon homing , which led him to the discoveries of the effects of the earth 's magnetic field , the position of the sun , as well as olfactory navigation and visual cues involved in the process that pigeons use to find their way home . cornell university built keeton a loft large enough to house two thousand pigeons that were the subjects of keeton 's experiments on the behaviors and processes involved in pigeon homing . both students and faculty at cornell university , as well as other scientists from around the world came and worked alongside william keeton in his pigeon <unk> keeton is also known for his work in writing the biology textbook named biological science , that was first published by the w.w. norton & company in <year>. it took keeton approximately five years to write the first edition of the textbook . it went through three editions before his death in <year>. after keeton 's death the textbook was revised for editions <integer> , <integer> , and <integer> by james l. gould ( and carol gould ) . the textbook was a combination of both botany and zoology . this combination of sciences turned out to be extremely

on <month> <integer> , <year> , due to a failure of a mechanical heart <unk> . he was <integer> years old . == work with pigeons == william keeton had always had a fascination with pigeon homing techniques from the time he was a child . when he was nine years old he received his first homing pigeons which he <unk> and trained with his friends . many scientists held speculative ideas about the techniques that pigeons might be using , including the use of the position of the sun , the earth 's magnetic field , landmark recognition and olfactory navigation . william keeton tested these various speculations throughout his time at cornell university . === magnetic interference === in william keeton 's <year> magnets interfere with pigeon homing paper , william keeton proved that pigeons were affected by changes in the magnetic field surrounding them , and that pigeons were using the earth 's magnetic field as one way of finding their way home . in this experiment , william keeton attached magnets to the back of pigeons just before they were released and measured their vanishing point ( in what direction they had flown out of sight ) and the time it took to find their way home for both the experimental birds and with the control birds ( control birds had a piece of <unk> <unk> to their back of the same weight as the <unk> ) . keeton 's results showed that when the sun was visible , the magnets would not usually prevent the birds from finding their way home , but when the sky was overcast the birds with magnets on their back were much more unsuccessful and <unk> at finding their way back home than the control birds . previous scientists had shown that pigeons were not relying entirely on the sun to navigate home as many scientists had speculated , when they found that many pigeons were able to navigate successfully under completely overcast skies . this notion led keeton to question whether the pigeons were using the earth 's magnetic field to orient themselves and navigate home successfully . keeton 's experiments with magnets showed that there was a combination of processes being used by the pigeons to navigate home , but the use of the earth 's magnetic field was very important for pigeon orientation and navigation . under clear skies with the sun visible , both the birds with magnets and the birds without magnets had little trouble <unk> back to the loft , yet at unfamiliar locations with overcast skies the birds with magnets <unk> to their backs were unable to successfully orient themselves and navigate back to the loft . keeton speculated that this was occurring because the birds without magnets were able to use the earth 's magnetic fields to orient themselves in the correct direction , whereas the birds with magnets attached to their backs were unable to use the sun , familiar <unk> , or the earth 's magnetic fields to find their way home . this discovery was extremely useful in explaining one of the most interesting questions of bird navigation . === olfactory interference === many scientists hypothesized that pigeons were using olfactory information as part of the process in finding their way back to the loft . in italy , a study by <unk> . baldaccini , in which the bills of pigeons were applied with a strong <unk> , showed results that the pigeons had less accurate initial orientation . baldaccini also performed an experiment in which he <unk> pigeons in a loft in which the wind was <unk> by <integer> degrees . baldaccini 's results showed that a deflection in the wind while the pigeons were young proved to have an effect on their initial orientation after being released . keeton replicated this experiment but found that there was a smaller deflection than the results in baldaccini 's experiment in italy . keeton speculated that there <month> be an effect on initial orientation based on an olfactory map , but the experiment was too general for proving that this was indeed what was occurring in this experiment . === bibliography of orientation publications === books and chapters keeton , william .

second evolution in spatial economics was due to <unk> lancaster . his insight was that the basic qualities that consumers seek could be <unk> by combining different products . hotelling had not considered this possibility . he had been content to accept that one good provided one underlying feature that could be measured in characteristics space . lancaster saw the matter in greater breadth . dinner was not just food on a table . it was an attempt to <unk> the basic <unk> of <unk> and nutrition into a satisfying <unk> experience . being a good cook meant knowing that taste had several dimensions including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . for a meal to be <unk> , it had to combine these elements of <unk> and it also had to be easily <unk> , suggesting that nutritional dimensions such as <unk> , protein content , and temperature had to figure into the cook ’ s understanding . these basic <unk> entities could each be thought of as lying on a <unk> scale , or space . the ideal meal , then , sought to combine these features by varying each one as precisely as possible . this theory provides a <unk> account of the difference between less developed ( so called `` primitive '' ) consumption economies , in which there are <unk> goods than characteristics , and more developed ( `` sophisticated '' ) consumption economies , in which there are more goods than characteristics , so that consumers can secure any combination of characteristics they desire , subject only to budget constraints . it also provides a way of predicting demand for new <unk> , so long as they do not <unk> any new <unk> to economist <unk> <unk> , `` he was widely regarded as a potential recipient of the nobel prize , for the notable impact that had been made by his contributions to the theory of

... and served only <unk> meat '' . : <integer> during the depths of the depression , his father worked as a theater <unk> . : <integer> according to biographer <unk> davidson , sagan 's `` inner war '' was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents , who were in many ways `` <unk> '' . sagan traced his later analytical <unk> to his mother , a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in new york city during world war i and the <year>s . : <integer> as a young woman , she had held her own intellectual <unk> , but they were frustrated by social restrictions : her poverty , her status as a woman and a wife , and her jewish ethnicity . davidson notes that she therefore `` <unk> her only son , carl . he would fulfill her <unk> dreams . `` : <integer> however , he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father , who in his free time gave <unk> to the poor or helped <unk> <unk> tensions within new york 's <unk> industry . : <integer> although he was <unk> by carl 's intellectual abilities , he took his son 's inquisitiveness in <unk> and saw it as part of his growing up . : <integer> in his later years as a writer and scientist , sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to <unk> scientific points , as he did in his book <unk> of forgotten ancestors . : <integer> sagan describes his parents ' influence on his later thinking : my parents were not scientists . they knew almost nothing about science . but in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder , they taught me the two <unk> <unk> modes of thought that are central to the scientific method . sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the <year> new york world 's fair when he was four years old . the exhibits became a turning point in his life . he later recalled the moving map of the america of tomorrow exhibit : `` it showed beautiful <unk> and <unk> and little general motors cars all carrying people to <unk> , buildings with <unk> <unk> , flying <unk> it looked great ! `` : <integer> at other exhibits , he remembered how a <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> cell created a <unk> sound , and how the sound from a <unk> <unk> became a wave on an <unk> . he also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio : television . sagan wrote : : <integer> <unk> , the world held wonders of a kind i had never <unk> . how could a tone become a picture and light become a noise ? he also saw one of the fair 's most publicized events , the burial of a time capsule at <unk> meadows , which contained <unk> of the <year>s to be recovered by earth 's descendants in a future millennium . `` the time capsule <unk> carl '' , writes davidson . as an adult , sagan and his colleagues would create similar time <unk> that would be sent out into the <unk> ; these were the pioneer plaque and the voyager golden record <unk> , all of which were <unk> of sagan 's memories of the world 's fair . : <integer> during world war ii sagan 's family worried about the fate of their european relatives . sagan , however , was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war . he wrote , `` sure , we had relatives who were caught up in the holocaust . hitler was not a popular fellow in our household ... but on the other hand , i was fairly insulated from the <unk> of the war . '' his sister , carol , said that their mother `` above all wanted to protect carl ... she had an <unk> difficult time dealing with world war ii and the holocaust . `` : <integer> sagan 's book the demon-haunted world ( <year> ) included his memories of this <unk> period , when his family dealt with the <unk> of the war in europe but tried to prevent it from <unk> his optimistic spirit . === inquisitiveness about nature === soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature . sagan recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone , at the age of five , when his mother got him a library card . he wanted to learn what stars were , since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer : : <integer> i went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars ; ... and the answer was <unk> . it was that the sun was a star but really close . the stars were <unk> , but so far away they were just little points of light ... the scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me . it was a kind of religious experience . there was a <unk> to it , a <unk> , a scale which has never left me . never ever left me . at about age six or seven , he and a close friend took trips to the american museum of natural history across the east river in manhattan . while there , they went to the <unk> <unk> and walked around the museum 's exhibits of space objects , such as <unk> , and displays of <unk> and animals in natural <unk> . sagan writes about those visits : : <integer> i was <unk> by the <unk> representations of animals and their habitats all over the world . penguins on the <unk> <unk> antarctic ice ; ... a family of <unk> , the male beating his <unk> , ... an american <unk> bear standing on his <unk> legs , ten or twelve feet tall , and <unk> me right in the eye . his parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials . his interest in space , however , was his primary focus , especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as h. g. wells and edgar rice burroughs , which <unk> his <unk> about life on other planets such as mars . according to biographer ray <unk> , these early years as sagan tried to understand the <unk> of the planets became a `` driving force in his life , a <unk> spark to his intellect , and a quest that would never be forgotten '' .in <year> he discovered <unk> science fiction magazine , which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in burroughs 's novels . that same year inaugurated the `` flying saucer '' mass <unk> with the young carl <unk> that the `` discs '' might be alien <unk> . === high-school years === sagan had lived in bensonhurst , where he went to david a. <unk> junior high school . he had his bar <unk> in bensonhurst when he turned <decimal> : <integer> the following year , <year> , his family moved to the town of rahway , new jersey , for his father 's work , where sagan then entered rahway high school . he graduated in <year>. : <integer> rahway was an older <unk> town . : <integer> sagan was a <unk> student but was bored due to <unk> classes and <unk> teachers . : <integer> his teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school , the administrator telling them , `` this <unk> ought to go to a school for gifted children , he has something really remarkable . `` : <integer> however , his parents could not afford it . sagan was made president of the school 's chemistry club , and at home he set up his own laboratory . he taught himself about molecules by making <unk> <unk> to help him <unk> how molecules were formed : `` i found that about as interesting as doing [ chemical ] experiments , '' he said . : <integer> sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a <unk> and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed : `` that was a splendid <unk> i began to suspect that if i tried hard i could do astronomy full-time , not just part-time . `` : <integer> before the end of high school , he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on earth as it was for native americans when they first had contact with <unk> . the subject was considered controversial , but his <unk> skill won over the judges , and they awarded him first prize . by graduation , his <unk> had voted him `` most likely to succeed '' and put him in line to be <unk> . === university education === sagan attended the university of chicago , which was one of the few colleges he applied to that would , despite his excellent high-school <unk> , consider admitting a <unk> . its chancellor , robert <month>nard <unk> , had recently <unk> the undergraduate college of the university of chicago into an `` ideal <unk> '' built on great books , <unk> dialogue , comprehensive examinations and early entrance to college with no age requirement . the school also employed a number of the nation 's leading scientists , including enrico fermi and edward teller , along with operating the famous yerkes <unk> his time as an honors program undergraduate , sagan worked in the laboratory of the geneticist h. j. muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist harold urey . sagan joined the <unk> astronomical society , received a b.a . degree in <unk> <unk> `` nothing '' with general and special honors in <year> , and a b.s . degree in physics in <year>. he went on to earn a m.s . degree in physics in <year> , before earning a phd degree in <year> with his thesis physical studies of the planets submitted to the department of astronomy and <unk> used the summer months of his graduate studies to work with his dissertation director , planetary scientist gerard kuiper , as well as physicist george <unk> and chemist melvin <unk> . the title of sagan 's dissertation reflects his shared interests with kuiper , who throughout the <year>s had been president of the international astronomical union 's commission on `` physical studies of planets and satellites '' . in <year> , the two worked on the classified military project a119 , the secret air force plan to <unk> a nuclear <unk> on the <unk> had a top secret clearance at the u.s. air force and a secret clearance with nasa . while working on his doctoral dissertation , sagan revealed us government classified titles of two project a119 papers when he applied for a university of california , berkeley scholarship in <year>. the leak was not publicly revealed until <year> , when it was published in the journal nature . a follow-up letter to the journal by project leader leonard <unk> confirmed sagan 's security leak . == career and research == from <year> to <year> sagan was a miller fellow at the university of california , berkeley . meanwhile , he published an article in <year> in the journal science on the atmosphere of venus , while also working with nasa 's mariner <integer> team , and served as a `` planetary sciences consultant '' to the rand <unk> the publication of sagan 's science article , in <year> harvard university astronomers fred whipple and donald menzel offered sagan the opportunity to give a <unk> at harvard and subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution . sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor , and eventually whipple and menzel were able to convince harvard to offer sagan the assistant professor position he requested . sagan lectured , performed research , and advised graduate students at the institution from <year> until <year> , as well as working at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory , also located in cambridge , massachusetts . in <year> , sagan was denied tenure at harvard . he later indicated that the decision was very much unexpected . the tenure denial has been blamed on several factors , including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas ( while the <unk> in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow <unk> ) , and perhaps because of his <unk> scientific advocacy , which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than <unk> . an advisor from his years as an undergraduate student , harold urey , wrote a letter to the tenure committee <unk> strongly against tenure for sagan . long before the <unk> tenure process , cornell university astronomer thomas gold had <unk> sagan to move to ithaca , new york , and join the faculty at cornell . following the denial of tenure from harvard , sagan accepted gold 's offer and remained a faculty member at cornell for nearly <integer> years until his death in <year>. unlike harvard , the smaller and more <unk> astronomy department at cornell welcomed sagan 's growing celebrity status . following two years as an associate professor , sagan became a full professor at cornell in <year> and directed the laboratory for planetary studies there . from <year> to <year> , he was associate director of the center for <unk> and space research ( <unk> ) at cornell . in <year> , he became the david duncan professor of astronomy and space sciences , a position he held for the remainder of his <unk> was associated with the u.s. space program from its inception . from the <year>s onward , he worked as an advisor to nasa , where one of his duties included <unk> the apollo astronauts before their flights to the moon . sagan contributed to many of the <unk> spacecraft missions that explored the solar system , <unk> experiments on many of the expeditions . sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space : a <unk> plaque , attached to the space <unk> pioneer <integer> , launched in <year>. pioneer <integer> , also carrying another copy of the plaque , was launched the following year . he continued to <unk> his designs ; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and <unk> was the voyager golden record , which was sent out with the voyager space probes in <year>. sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the space <unk> and the international space station at the expense of further <unk> missions . === scientific achievements === former student david morrison described sagan as `` an <unk> person ' and a master of <unk> physical arguments and <unk> of the envelope ' calculations '' , and gerard kuiper said that `` some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory ; others are best in liaison between sciences . dr. sagan belongs in the latter group . `` sagan 's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet venus . in the early <year>s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of venus ' surface , and sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a time life book planets . his own view was that venus was <unk> and very hot as opposed to the <unk> <unk> others had <unk> . he had investigated radio waves from venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of <integer> °c ( <integer> <unk> ) . as a visiting scientist to nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory , he contributed to the first mariner missions to venus , working on the design and management of the project . mariner <integer> confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of venus in <year> . sagan was among the first to <unk> that <unk> 's moon titan might possess oceans of <unk> compounds on its surface and that jupiter 's moon europa might possess <unk> oceans of water . this would make europa potentially habitable . europa 's <unk> ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft <unk> . the mystery of titan 's <unk> <unk> was also solved with sagan 's help . the <unk> <unk> was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly <unk> down onto titan 's <unk> further contributed insights regarding the <unk> of venus and jupiter , as well as seasonal changes on mars . he also perceived global warming as a growing , <unk> danger and likened it to the natural development of venus into a hot , <unk> planet through a kind of <unk> greenhouse effect . sagan and his cornell colleague edwin ernest <unk> speculated about life in jupiter 's clouds , given the planet 's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules . he studied the observed color variations on mars ' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or <unk> changes as most believed , but shifts in surface dust caused by <unk> . sagan is also known for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life , including experimental demonstration of the production of <unk> <unk> from basic chemicals by <unk> is also the <year> recipient of the public welfare medal , the highest award of the national academy of sciences for `` distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare '' . he was denied membership in the academy , reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other <unk> of <year> , sagan is the most cited seti scientist and one of the most cited planetary scientists . === cosmos : popularizing science on tv === in <year> sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning <unk> pbs television series cosmos : a personal voyage , which became the most widely watched series in the history of american public television until <year>. the show has been seen by at least <integer> million people across <integer> countries . the book , cosmos , written by sagan , was published to accompany the <unk> of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his best-selling books , including the dragons of eden , which won him a pulitzer prize in <year> , he was asked to write and <unk> the show . it was targeted to a general audience of <unk> , whom sagan felt had lost interest in science , partly due to a <unk> educational <unk> of the <integer> episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person , thereby demonstrating the <unk> of the universe . they covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans ' place on earth . the show won an <unk> , along with a peabody award , and transformed sagan from an obscure astronomer into a <unk> icon . time magazine ran a cover story about sagan soon after the show broadcast , referring to him as `` creator , chief writer and <unk> of the show '' . in <year> , `` cosmos '' was released on a <unk> set of <unk> . === `` billions and billions '' === sagan was invited to frequent appearances on the <unk> show starring <unk> carson . after cosmos aired , he became associated with the <unk> `` billions and billions , '' although he never actually used the phrase in the cosmos series . he rather used the term `` billions upon billions . '' carson , however , would sometimes use the phrase during his <unk> of sagan . ==== sagan unit ==== as a humorous tribute to sagan and his association with the <unk> `` billions and billions '' , a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number – technically at least four billion ( two billion plus two billion ) – of anything . === sagan 's number === sagan 's number is the number of stars in the <unk> universe . this number is reasonably well defined , because it is known what stars are and what the <unk> universe is , but its value is highly uncertain . in <year> , sagan estimated it to be <integer> sextillion in short scale ( <year> ) . in <year> , it was estimated to be <integer> sextillion ( <integer> × <year> ) . in <year> , it was estimated to be <integer> sextillion ( <integer> × <year> ) . === scientific and critical thinking advocacy === sagan 's ability to <unk> his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos <unk> emphasizing the value and <unk> of the human race , and the relative <unk> of the earth in comparison to the universe . he delivered the <year> series of royal institution christmas lectures in <unk> was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life . he urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial <unk> . sagan was so persuasive that by <year> he was able to get a petition advocating seti published in the journal science , signed by <integer> scientists , including seven nobel prize winners . this <unk> a tremendous increase in the <unk> of a <unk> field . sagan also helped frank drake write the arecibo message , a radio message <unk> into space from the arecibo radio telescope on <month> <integer> , <year> , aimed at <unk> potential <unk> about earth . sagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal <unk> for <integer> years . he co-founded the planetary society and was a member of the seti institute board of trustees . sagan served as chairman of the division for planetary science of the american astronomical society , as president of the <unk> section of the american geophysical union , and as chairman of the astronomy section of the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ) . at the height of the cold war , sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war , when paul <unk> 's `` <unk> at noon '' concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could <unk> a nuclear <unk> and upset the <unk> balance of life on earth by cooling the surface . in <year> he was one of five <unk> `` s '' <unk> the follow-up `` <unk> '' model ( as the research article came to be known ) , which contained the first use of the term `` nuclear winter '' , which his colleague richard p. <unk> had coined . in <year> he co-authored the book the cold and the dark : the world after nuclear war and in <year> the book a path where no man thought : nuclear winter and the end of the arms race , which explains the <unk> hypothesis and advocates nuclear disarmament . sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to <unk> a very uncertain hypothesis . a personal correspondence with nuclear physicist edward teller around <year> began <unk> , with teller expressing support for continued research to <unk> the credibility of the winter hypothesis . however , sagan and teller 's correspondence would ultimately result in teller writing : `` a propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion . i can <unk> you on being , indeed , an excellent propagandist , remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one '' . <unk> of sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint , nuclear winter was a low point for sagan , although , politically speaking , it popularized his image amongst the <unk> adult sagan remained a fan of science fiction , although <unk> stories that were not realistic ( such as ignoring the <unk> law ) or , he said , did not include `` <unk> pursuit of alternative futures '' . he wrote books to popularize science , such as cosmos , which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of a personal voyage and became the best-selling science book ever published in english ; the dragons of eden : speculations on the evolution of human intelligence , which won a pulitzer prize ; and <unk> 's brain : reflections on the <unk> of science . sagan also wrote the best-selling science fiction novel contact in <year> , based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife , ann druyan , in <year> , but he did not live to see the book 's <year> <unk> adaptation , which <unk> <unk> foster and won the <year> hugo award for best dramatic presentation . sagan wrote a <unk> to cosmos , pale blue dot : a vision of the human future in space , which was selected as a notable book of <year> by the new york times . he appeared on pbs 's charlie rose program in <month> <year>. sagan also wrote the introduction for stephen <unk> 's bestseller a brief history of time . sagan was also known for his popularization of science , his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public , and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience , such as his <unk> of the betty and <unk> hill <unk> . to mark the tenth anniversary of sagan 's death , david morrison , a former student of sagan , recalled `` sagan 's immense contributions to planetary research , the public understanding of science , and the skeptical movement '' in skeptical <unk> . following <unk> <unk> 's threats to light kuwait 's oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to iraqi control of the oil assets , sagan together with his `` <unk> '' colleagues and paul <unk> , warned in <month> <year> in the baltimore sun and <unk> morning star newspapers that if the fires were left to <unk> over a period of several months , enough smoke from the <integer> or so <year> kuwaiti oil fires `` might get so high as to <unk> agriculture in much of south asia ... '' and that this possibility should `` affect the war plans '' ; these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between sagan and physicist fred singer on <month> <integer> , aired on the abc news program <unk> . in the televised debate , sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter , with singer arguing to the contrary . after the debate , the fires <unk> for many months before <unk> efforts were complete . the results of the smoke did not produce <unk> cooling . sagan later <unk> in the demon-haunted world that the prediction did not turn out to be correct : `` it was <unk> black at noon and temperatures dropped <other>–6 °c over the persian gulf , but not much smoke reached <unk> <unk> and asia was <unk> '' .in his later years sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for <unk> objects ( <unk> ) that might impact the earth but to <unk> or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them . he argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid , including the employment of nuclear <unk> , created a deflection dilemma : if the ability to <unk> an asteroid away from the earth exists , then one would also have the ability to <unk> a <unk> object towards earth , creating an <unk> destructive weapon . in a <year> paper he co-authored , he ridiculed a <unk> long `` <unk> object <unk> workshop '' held by los <unk> national laboratory ( <unk> ) in <year> that did not , `` even in passing '' state that such <unk> and deflection technologies could have these `` <unk> dangers '' <unk> remained <unk> that the natural <unk> impact threat and the <unk> <unk> essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a `` new and <unk> motivation to <unk> international relations '' . later <unk> that , with sufficient international <unk> , in the future a `` work our way up '' approach to implementing nuclear <unk> deflection methods could be <unk> , and when sufficient knowledge was gained , to use them to aid in mining <unk> . his interest in the use of nuclear <unk> in space grew out of his work in <year> for the <unk> research foundation 's project a119 , concerning the possibility of <unk> a nuclear device on the lunar <unk> was a critic of plato , having said of the ancient greek philosopher : `` science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the <unk> . this tendency found its most effective advocate in a <unk> of <unk> named plato '' and he ( plato ) believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world . he advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets . it was better , he believed , just to think about them . plato expressed <unk> to observation and experiment . he taught <unk> for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge . plato 's followers succeeded in <unk> the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by <unk> and the other <unk> . in <year> ( as part of his book the demon-haunted world ) sagan popularized a set of tools for skeptical thinking called the `` <unk> <unk> <unk> '' , a phrase first coined by arthur <unk> , a friend of his wife ann druyan . === popularizing science === speaking about his activities in popularizing science , sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state . simple self-interest was one : much of the funding for science came from the public , and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent . if scientists increased public <unk> for science , there was a good chance of having more public supporters . the other reason was the excitement of communicating one 's own excitement about science to <unk> the success of cosmos , sagan set up his own publishing firm , cosmos store , in order to publish science books for the general public . it was not successful . === criticisms === while sagan was widely <unk> by the general public , his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized . critics sometimes characterized his work as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity <unk> of sagan 's <unk> critics , harold urey , felt that sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too <unk> . urey and sagan were said to have different <unk> of science , according to davidson . while urey was an `` <unk> <unk> '' who avoided <unk> about the unknown , sagan was by contrast willing to <unk> openly about such matters . fred whipple wanted harvard to keep sagan there , but learned that because urey was a nobel laureate , his opinion was an important factor in harvard denying sagan <unk> 's harvard friend lester grinspoon also stated : `` i know harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken . '' grinspoon added : wherever you turned , there was one astronomer being quoted on everything , one astronomer whose face you were seeing on tv , and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display <unk> at the local <unk> . some , like urey , later came to realize that sagan 's popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole . urey especially liked sagan 's <year> book the dragons of eden and wrote sagan with his opinion : `` i like it very much and am <unk> that someone like you has such an <unk> knowledge of the various features of the problem ... i <unk> you ... you are a man of many talents . `` sagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit and countered these claims by explaining that the <unk> was an <unk> side effect of his role as a science communicator and <unk> , and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible . === social concerns === sagan believed that the drake equation , on substitution of reasonable estimates , suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form , but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to <unk> . this stimulated his interest in identifying and <unk> ways that humanity could destroy itself , with the hope of avoiding such a <unk> and eventually becoming a <unk> species . sagan 's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was <unk> in a memorable <unk> sequence in the final episode of cosmos , called `` who speaks for earth ? '' sagan had already resigned from the air force scientific advisory board 's ufo investigating condon committee and <unk> surrendered his <unk> clearance in protest over the vietnam war . following his marriage to his third wife ( novelist ann druyan ) in <month> <year> , sagan became more politically <unk> in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under president ronald reagan . in <month> <year> , reagan announced the strategic defense <unk> <unk> project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles , which was quickly dubbed the `` star wars '' program . sagan spoke out against the project , arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of <unk> required , and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through <unk> and other <unk> that its construction would seriously <unk> the `` nuclear balance '' between the united states and the soviet union , making further progress toward nuclear disarmament <unk> soviet leader mikhail gorbachev declared a unilateral <unk> on the testing of nuclear weapons , which would begin on <month> <integer> , <unk> <days> anniversary of the atomic bombing of <unk> reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit . in response , us anti-nuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the nevada test site , beginning on easter <dayofweek> in <year> and continuing through <year>. hundreds of people in the `` nevada desert experience '' group were arrested , including sagan , who was arrested on two separate occasions as he <unk> over a <unk> fence at the test site during the underground operation <unk> and united states 's <unk> nuclear test series of <unk> was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning , arguing in <year> that human <unk> could become <unk> by an `` unusually severe [ case of ] testosterone poisoning '' and this could <unk> them to become <unk> . in his review of <unk> magazine writer <unk> <unk> 's <year> book women on war , he argues that females are the only half of humanity `` <unk> by testosterone poisoning '' . one chapter of his <year> book <unk> of forgotten ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged <unk> <unk> <year> , carl sagan was interviewed by ted turner whether he believed in socialism and responded that : `` i 'm not sure what a socialist is . but i believe the government has a responsibility to care for the people ... i 'm talking about making the people self-reliant . '' == personal life and beliefs == sagan was married three times . in <year> , he married biologist lynn <unk> . the couple had two children , jeremy and <unk> sagan . after sagan and <unk> divorced , he married artist linda <unk> in <year> and they also had a child together , <unk> sagan . during these marriages , carl sagan focused heavily on his career , a factor which <month> have contributed to sagan 's first divorce . in <year> , sagan married author ann druyan and they later had two children , alexandra ( known as sasha ) and samuel sagan . carl sagan and druyan remained married until his death in <year> . while teaching at cornell , he lived in an egyptian revival house in ithaca <unk> on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a cornell secret society . while there he drove a <unk> <year> <unk> <integer> with the license plate <unk> . he also owned an orange <unk> <integer> . in <year> , engineers at apple computer code-named the power <unk> <integer> `` carl sagan '' in the hope that apple would make `` billions and billions '' with the sale of the <unk> <decimal> the name was only used internally , but sagan was concerned that it would become a product <unk> and sent apple a <unk> letter . apple <unk> , but engineers <unk> by changing the internal <unk> to `` <unk> '' for `` <unk> astronomer '' . sagan then sued apple for <unk> in federal court . the court granted apple 's motion to dismiss sagan 's claims and <unk> in <unk> that a reader aware of the context would understand apple was `` clearly attempting to <unk> in a humorous and <unk> way '' , and that `` it <unk> reason to conclude that <unk> was attempting to criticize plaintiff 's reputation or <unk> as an astronomer . one does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the <unk> phrase <unk> ' . '' sagan then sued for apple 's original use of his name and <unk> , but again lost . sagan appealed the ruling . in <month> <year> , an <unk> settlement was reached and apple 's office of trademarks and patents released a <unk> statement that `` apple has always had great respect for dr. sagan . it was never apple 's intention to cause dr. sagan or his family any <unk> or concern . '' apple 's third and final code name for the project was `` law '' , short for `` lawyers are <unk> '' .in <year> , carl sagan 's daughter sasha sagan released for small creatures such as we : rituals for finding meaning in our unlikely world , which depicts life with her parents and her father 's death when she was fourteen . building on a theme in her father 's work , sasha sagan argues in for small creatures such as we that skepticism does not <unk> <unk> . sagan was acquainted with the science fiction <unk> through his friendship with <unk> asimov , and he spoke at the <unk> awards ceremony in <year>. asimov described sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own . the other , he claimed , was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert <unk> <unk> . === <unk> === sagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science , expressing his skepticism about the conventional <unk> of god as a <unk> being . for example : some people think god is an <unk> , <unk> male with a long white beard , sitting on a <unk> somewhere up there in the sky , <unk> <unk> the fall of every sparrow . <unk> example <unk> spinoza and albert <unk> god to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe . i do not know of any compelling evidence for <unk> <unk> controlling human <unk> from some hidden <unk> vantage point , but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws . in another description of his view on the concept of god , sagan wrote : the idea that god is an <unk> white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and <unk> the fall of every sparrow is <unk> . but if by god one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe , then clearly there is such a god . this god is emotionally <unk> ... it does not make much sense to <unk> to the law of gravity . on <unk> , sagan commented in <year> : an atheist is someone who is certain that god does not exist , someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of god . i know of no such compelling evidence . because god can be <unk> to remote times and places and to ultimate causes , we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such god exists . to be certain of the existence of god and to be certain of the <unk> of god seem to me to be the <unk> <unk> in a subject so <unk> with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed . sagan also commented on christianity and the jefferson bible , stating `` my long-time view about christianity is that it <unk> an <unk> of two <unk> <unk> parts , the religion of jesus and the religion of paul . thomas jefferson attempted to <unk> the <unk> parts of the new testament . there was n't much left when he was done , but it was an inspiring document . '' regarding spirituality and its relationship with science , sagan stated : <unk> ' comes from the latin word <unk> <unk> ' . what we <unk> is air , which is certainly matter , however <unk> . despite usage to the contrary , there is no necessary <unk> in the word <unk> ' that we are talking of anything other than matter ( including the matter of which the brain is made ) , or anything outside the realm of science . on occasion , i will feel free to use the word . science is not only compatible with spirituality ; it is a profound source of spirituality . when we recognize our place in an <unk> of <unk> and in the passage of ages , when we grasp the <unk> , beauty , and <unk> of life , then that <unk> feeling , that sense of <unk> and <unk> combined , is surely spiritual . an environmental appeal , `` <unk> and <unk> the earth '' , signed by sagan with other noted scientists in <month> <year> , stated that `` the historical record makes clear that religious teaching , example , and leadership are <unk> able to influence personal conduct and commitment ... thus , there is a vital role for religion and science . '' in reply to a question in <year> about his religious beliefs , sagan answered , `` i 'm agnostic . '' sagan maintained that the idea of a creator god of the universe was difficult to prove or <unk> and that the only <unk> scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an <unk> old universe . sagan 's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of <unk> comparable to einstein 's belief in spinoza 's god . his son , <unk> sagan said , `` my father believed in the god of spinoza and einstein , god not behind nature but as nature , equivalent to it . '' his last wife , ann druyan , stated : when my husband died , because he was so famous and known for not being a believer , many people would come up to <unk> still sometimes <unk> ask me if carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an <unk> . they also frequently ask me if i think i will see him again . carl faced his death with <unk> courage and never sought refuge in illusions . the tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again . i do n't ever expect to be reunited with carl . in <year> , ann druyan edited sagan 's <year> glasgow <unk> lectures in natural theology into a book , the varieties of scientific experience : a personal view of the search for god , in which he <unk> on his views of <unk> in the natural world . sagan is also widely regarded as a <unk> or skeptic ; one of his most famous quotations , in cosmos , was , `` extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence '' ( called the `` sagan standard '' by some ) . this was based on a nearly <unk> statement by fellow founder of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , `` an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof . '' this idea had been earlier <unk> in <unk> <unk> 's work from india to the planet mars ( <year> ) from a longer quote by <unk> laplace ( <unk> ) , a french mathematician and astronomer , as the principle of laplace : `` the weight of the evidence should be <unk> to the <unk> of the facts . `` late in his life , sagan 's books elaborated on his <unk> view of the world . in the demon-haunted world , he presented tools for testing arguments and <unk> <unk> or <unk> ones , essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method . the compilation billions and billions : thoughts on life and death at the brink of the millennium , published in <year> after sagan 's death , contains essays written by sagan , such as his views on abortion , as well as an account by his widow , ann druyan , of his death in relation to his having been an agnostic and <unk> . sagan warned against humans ' tendency towards <unk> . he was the faculty adviser for the cornell students for the ethical treatment of animals . in the cosmos chapter `` <unk> for a red planet '' , sagan wrote , `` if there is life on mars , i believe we should do nothing with mars . mars then belongs to the martians , even if the martians are only <unk> . '' === marijuana advocacy === sagan was a <unk> and advocate of marijuana . under the pseudonym `` mr. x '' , he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the <year> book <unk> <unk> . the essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of sagan 's works and enhance <unk> and intellectual experiences . after sagan 's death , his friend lester grinspoon disclosed this information to sagan 's biographer , <unk> davidson . the publishing of the biography , carl sagan : a life , in <year> brought media attention to this aspect of sagan 's life . not long after his death , his widow ann druyan went on to <unk> over the board of directors of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws ( <unk> ) , a non-profit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws . === ufos === in <year> , the year that inaugurated the `` flying saucer '' <unk> , the young sagan suspected the `` discs '' might be alien <unk> 's interest in ufo reports prompted him on <month> <integer> , <year> , to write a letter to u.s. secretary of state dean acheson to ask how the united states would respond if flying <unk> turned out to be extraterrestrial . : <unk> he later had several conversations on the subject in <year> with jacques <unk> . though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the ufo question , sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon , at least because there was widespread public interest in ufo reports . stuart <unk> notes that sagan `` wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding ufos and the <unk> experience . sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining ufo reports and that the subject was , therefore , a <unk> topic of study . `` in <year> sagan was a member of the ad hoc committee to review project blue book , the u.s. air force 's ufo investigation project . the committee concluded blue book had been lacking as a scientific study , and recommended a <unk> project to give the ufo phenomenon closer scientific <unk> . the result was the condon committee ( <year>–68 ) , led by physicist edward condon , and in their final report they formally concluded that ufos , regardless of what any of them actually were , did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security . sociologist ron <unk> writes that `` the high point of sagan 's treatment of the ufo question was the aaas ' symposium in <year>. a wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants , including not only proponents such as james mcdonald and j. allen <unk> but also <unk> like astronomers william <unk> and donald menzel . the <unk> of speakers was balanced , and it is to sagan 's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from edward condon . '' with physicist thornton page , sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium ; these were published in <year> as ufo 's : a scientific debate . some of sagan 's many books examine ufos ( as did one episode of cosmos ) and he claimed a religious <unk> to the phenomenon . sagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his <year> cosmos series . in one of his last written works , sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting earth are <unk> small . however , sagan did think it <unk> that cold war concerns contributed to governments <unk> their citizens about ufos , and wrote that `` some ufo reports and analyses , and perhaps voluminous files , have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills ... it 's time for the files to be <unk> and made generally available . '' he <unk> against jumping to conclusions about suppressed ufo data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that <unk> were visiting the earth either in the past or <unk> briefly served as an adviser on stanley <unk> 's film <year> : a space odyssey . : <integer> sagan proposed that the film suggest , rather than <unk> , extraterrestrial <unk> . === `` sagan 's paradox '' === sagan 's contribution to the <year> aaas symposium was an attack on the belief that ufos are <unk> by extraterrestrial beings . applying several logical assumptions ( see drake equation ) , sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million . he projected that any civilization wishing to <unk> on all the others on a regular basis of , say , once a year would have to launch <other>0,000 spacecraft annually . not only does that seem like an <unk> number of <unk> , but it would take all the material in one percent of the universe 's stars to produce all the <unk> needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out . to argue that the earth was being chosen for regular <unk> , sagan said , one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique , and that assumption `` goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around . because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common . and if we 're not pretty common then there are n't going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send <unk> '' . this argument , which some called sagan 's paradox , helped to establish a new school of thought , namely the belief that extraterrestrial life exists , but it has nothing to do with ufos . the new belief had a <unk> effect on ufo studies . it helped separate researchers who wanted to distinguish ufos from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life <unk> by the <unk> associated with ufos . === death === after suffering from <unk> for two years and receiving three <unk> <unk> transplants from his sister , sagan died from pneumonia at the age of <integer> at the fred hutchinson cancer research center

athens economic research center , and advisor to the bank of greece . in <year> , his father george papandreou , head of the center union , became prime minister of greece . andreas became his chief economic advisor . he <unk> his american citizenship and was elected to the greek parliament in the <year> greek legislative election . he immediately became minister to the first ministry of state ( in effect , assistant prime minister ) . papandreou took publicly a neutral stand during the cold war and wished for greece to be more independent from the united states . he also criticized the massive presence of american military and intelligence in greece , and sought to remove senior officers with <unk> tendencies from the greek military . he disagreed also with the american policy on the cyprus dispute . in <year> , while the `` <unk> '' <unk> within the <unk> army ( alleged by the political opposition to involve andreas personally ) was being investigated , georgios papandreou decided to remove the defense minister and assume the post himself . constantine ii of greece refused to endorse this move and essentially forced george papandreou 's resignation during the events of the <unk> of <year>. greece entered a period of political <unk> and instability which ended with the coup d'état of <integer> <month> <year> . when the greek colonels led by georgios <unk> seized power in <month> <year> , andreas was <unk> . <unk> <unk> , a <unk> ranking cia officer in greece who was close to the colonels who led the coup , advised them to `` shoot the <unk> because he 's going to come back to <unk> you '' . his father george papandreou was put under house arrest . george , already at advanced age , died in <year>. under heavy pressure from american academics and intellectuals , such as john kenneth galbraith , a friend of andreas since their harvard days , the military regime released andreas on condition that he leave the country . papandreou then moved to sweden with his wife , four children , and mother . there he accepted a post at stockholm university . in paris , while in exile , andreas papandreou formed an <unk> organization , the panhellenic liberation movement ( pak ) , and <unk> the world <unk> opposition to the greek military regime . despite his former american citizenship and academic career in the united states , papandreou held the central intelligence agency responsible for the <year> coup and became increasingly critical of the federal government of the united states , often stating that greece was under `` us occupation '' . in the early <year>s , during the latter phase of the dictatorship in greece , papandreou , along with most leading greek politicians in exile or in greece , opposed the process of political <unk> attempted by georgios <unk> and his appointed pm , <unk> <unk> . on <integer> <month> <year> , andreas papandreou called an extraordinary meeting of the national congress of pak in <unk> , switzerland , which decided its dissolution without announcing it <unk> returned to greece after the events in cyprus and the fall of the junta in <year> , during metapolitefsi . he was offered the leadership of his father 's old party , which had evolved into centre union – new forces . however , he not only turned it down , but rejected his father 's ideological heritage as a <unk> liberal , declaring himself a democratic socialist . to that end , he formed a new `` radical '' party , the panhellenic socialist movement ( pasok ) . most of his former pak companions , as well as members of other leftist groups such as the democratic defense joined in the new party . he also testified in the first of the greek junta trials about the alleged involvement of the junta with the central intelligence agency ( cia ) . in the <year> elections , pasok received only <decimal> % of the vote , but in <year> it <unk> <integer> % , and papandreou became leader of the opposition . === the `` change '' === at the <year> elections , pasok won a landslide victory over the conservative new democracy party , and papandreou became greece 's first socialist prime minister . the party 's main slogan was <unk> ( change ) . in office , papandreou <unk> from much of his campaign rhetoric and followed a more conventional approach . greece did not withdraw from nato , united states troops and military bases were not ordered out of greece , and greek membership in the european economic community continued , largely because papandreou proved very capable of securing monetary aid for greece . in domestic affairs , papandreou 's government immediately carried out a massive programme of wealth redistribution upon coming into office that immediately increased the <unk> of entitlement aid to the unemployed and lower wage earners . pensions , together with average wages and the minimum wage , were increased in real terms , and changes were made to labour laws which up until <year> made it difficult for employers to make workers <unk> . the impact of the pasok government 's social and economic policies was such that it was estimated in <year> that two-thirds of the decrease in inequality that occurred in greece between <year> and <year> took place between <year> and <year>.during its time in office , papandreou 's government carried through sweeping reforms of social policy by introducing a welfare state , significantly expanding welfare measures , expanding health care coverage ( the `` national health system '' was instituted , which made modern medical procedures available in rural areas for the first time , ) promoting <unk> tourism ( social tourism ) for <unk> families , <unk> pensions , and funding social establishments for the <unk> . rural areas benefited from improved state services , the rights and income of low paid workers were considerably improved , and refugees from the civil war living in exile were allowed to return with <unk> . he also officially recognized the role of leftist partisan groups in the greek resistance during the axis occupation . the first law recognizing the greek resistance was passed in <year> excluding partisan groups that fought against the greek state in the greek civil war ( <unk> . <integer> ) in <year> his government passed the <year> law that abolished this <unk> more progressive taxation scheme was introduced and <unk> support for artistic and cultural programmes was increased . the government also introduced a wage indexation system which helped to close the gap <unk> between the highest and lowest paid workers , while the share of gnp devoted to social welfare , social insurance , and health was significantly increased . other major policy changes included the establishment of <unk> leave for both parents and child care centres , maternity <unk> , community health centres , and the encouragement of women to join agricultural cooperatives as full members , an option which previously had not been open to <unk> part of papandreou 's `` social contract '' , new <unk> laws were introduced which <unk> <unk> , abolished ( in theory ) the <unk> system , <unk> the process for obtaining a divorce , and <unk> the legal status of women . in <year> , for instance , women were guaranteed equal pay for equal work . papandreou also introduced various reforms in the administration and curriculum of the greek educational system , allowing students to participate in the election process for their professors and <unk> in the university , and abolishing tenure . the university system was expanded , with the number of students <unk> between <year> and <year> , while the system was <unk> to provide the departments with more power and permit greater participation in their management . the effect of these reforms was however , limited by poor research facilities , a shortage of qualified teaching staff , a lack of resources , and often inefficient <unk> a move strongly opposed by the church of greece , papandreou introduced , for the first time in greece , the process of civil marriage . prior to the institution of civil marriages in greece , the only <unk> recognized marriages were those conducted in the church of greece . <unk> seeking a civil marriage had to get married outside greece , generally in italy . under pasok , the greek state also <unk> real estate properties previously owned by the church . a major part of papandreou 's <unk> ( `` change '' ) involved driving out the `` old families '' ( <unk> , literally `` <unk> '' , using the traditional greek expression for the genealogy of families ) , which dominated greek politics and economy and belonged to the traditional greek right . papandreou was <unk> re-elected in the <year> greek legislative election with <integer> % of the vote , and won still further popularity in <month> <year> by his strong leadership during the <year> <unk> crisis in the <unk> sea . however , from the summer of <year> , his premiership became increasingly <unk> by controversy , as the bank of crete scandal exploded . in <year> , he divorced his wife margaret papandreou and married <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , <integer> <month> <year> ) , without issue . === `` koskotas scandal '' , trial and return to power === in <year> , after the arrest of george koskotas in the us , he was <unk> by the <unk> parliament in connection with a us $ <integer> million bank of crete <unk> scandal , and was accused of <unk> the <unk> by ordering state corporations to transfer their holdings to the bank of crete , where the interest was allegedly <unk> off to benefit pasok , and possibly some of its highest functionaries . following the many repercussions of the so-called koskotas scandal , pasok was <unk> defeated at the <month> <year> elections , losing <integer> seats in one of the largest <unk> of a sitting government in modern greek history . however , due to changes made in electoral law one year before the elections by the then <unk> pasok administration , new democracy was not able to form a government despite finishing with the most seats . the new law required a party to win <integer> percent of the vote to govern alone , and <unk> had come up just short of that threshold . as a result , even though new democracy finished <integer> seats ahead of pasok , it was unable to <unk> support from the five mps it needed to make its leader , <unk> mitsotakis , prime minister . the ensuing <unk> led to fresh elections in <month> <year> greek legislative election . papandreou 's pasok 's won <integer> % of the popular vote , compared to the rival new democracy 's <integer> % . as before , even though new democracy finished well ahead of pasok in seat count , it was not able to form a government . a third election in <year> followed , and mitsotakis eventually received enough support to form a government . in the wake of three <unk> elections between <year> and <year> , the new democracy leader , constantine mitsotakis , eventually received sufficient support to form a government . in <month> <year> , papandreou himself was cleared of any <unk> in the koskotas scandal after a <other>–6 vote in the specially convened supreme special court trial . after <integer> years of mitsotakis ' government , papandreou and pasok won again the <year> election , and returned to power ; in <year> , his government decided to impose an economic <unk> on the republic of <unk> . in <year> , an interim accord was signed between the two countries . however , his fragile health kept him from <unk> firm political leadership . he was hospitalized with advanced heart disease and renal failure on <integer> <month> <year> and finally retired from office on <integer> <month> <year>. he died on <integer> <month> <year> , with his funeral <unk> producing crowds , ranging from `` hundreds of thousands '' to `` millions '' to bid farewell to andreas . in <year> , papandreou was posthumously awarded the swedish order of the polar star . == economic policies == the expenditure programme of the papandreou government during <year>–1990 has been described as excessive by its conservative critics . the excessive expenditures were not accompanied by corresponding revenue increases and this led to increases in budget deficits and the public debt . many economic indicators worsened during <year>–1990 and the economic policies of his government were condemned as a failure by his critics . various <unk> of enterprises and the increase of the public sector was another point of critic by the conservatives . on the other hand , according to his supporters they were successful , drastically increasing the purchasing power of the vast majority of greeks , with personal incomes growing by <integer> % in real terms during the course of the <year>s . papandreou 's increased spending in his early years in power ( <year>–1985 ) was necessary in order to <unk> the deep wounds of the greek society , a society that was still deeply divided by the <unk> memories of the civil war and the right-wing repression that followed ; furthermore , the postwar government philosophy of the greek conservatives simply saw the state as a tool of repression , with very little money spent on health or education . furthermore , papandreou 's governments managed to handle the inflation and unemployment rate , maintain the growth of the economy , while according to his supporters the external debt in <year> was in normal levels ( around <integer> % of gdp ) . == international politics == papandreou was praised for conducting an independent and <unk> foreign policy , and proved to be a master of the diplomatic game , thus increasing the importance of greece in the international system . he was <unk> in <year> of , and subsequently an active participant in , a movement promoted by the <unk> for global action , the initiative of the six , which included , besides the greek pm , mexico 's president miguel de la madrid , argentina 's president raúl <unk> , sweden 's prime minister <unk> palme , tanzania 's president julius <unk> and india 's prime minister indira gandhi . the movement 's stated objective was the `` promotion of peace and progress for all mankind '' . after various initiatives , mostly directed at pressuring the united states and the soviet union to stop nuclear testing and reduce the level of nuclear arms , it eventually <unk> 's rhetoric was at times <unk> to the united states . he was the first western prime minister to visit general <unk> <unk> in poland . according to the foreign affairs magazine papandreou went on record as saying that since the ussr is not a capitalist country `` one can not label it an imperialist power . '' according to papandreou , `` the soviet union represent [ ed ] a factor that <unk> [ ed ] the expansion of capitalism and its <unk> aims '' . this <unk> stance made him extremely popular , because the previous conservative governments were seen by the greek people as <unk> loyal to us <unk> 's government was the first in post-war greece that <unk> the nation 's defense policy to suit its own security needs , and not those of the united states . according to historian marion <unk> , from <year> until <year> , the us had more influence in greece 's military policy than the <unk> greek high command , largely due to the decisive role played by the us in the greek civil <unk> supported the causes of various national liberation movements in the world , and agreed for greece to host representatives offices of many such organisations . he also supported the cause of palestinian liberation , met repeatedly with <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> and condemned israeli policies in the occupied <unk> . he was a supporter of the <unk> solution for the conflict . == papandreou 's image and influence in greek popular culture == among both his supporters and his opponents , papandreou was referred to simply by his first name , `` andreas '' , a unique situation in greek political history , and a testament to his <unk> and popularity . andreas was also famous for wearing his business <unk> with <unk> <unk> ( <unk> in greek ) , instead of the traditional white shirt and tie ; he thus created a huge fashion , mainly but not exclusively among his political supporters . his first appearance in the greek parliament with a black <unk> instead of shirt and tie caused a massive uproar in the conservative press , who considered him <unk> of parliament ; however , the whole issue only added to his popularity . == legacy == papandreou exercised a more independent foreign policy <unk> greece 's profile among <unk> nations . he affirmed greece 's independence in setting her own policy agenda , both internally and <unk> , free from any foreign domination . his opponents on the left , on the other hand , including the communist party of greece ( <unk> ) , accused him of supporting , in practice , the agenda of nato and the united states . andreas papandreou is widely acknowledged as having shifted political power from the traditional conservative greek right , which had dominated greek politics for decades , to a more populist and centre-left <unk> . this included the so-called <unk> in politics as of the end of the greek civil war , which were given a chance to prove themselves in <unk> elected governments . this shift in the greek political landscape helped <unk> some of the old civil war wounds ; greece became more <unk> , and more in line with the political system of other western european countries . papandreou also systematically pursued <unk> politics which ended the <unk> and economic <unk> of many social classes in the <unk> war <unk> is also acknowledged that papandreou , along with <unk> , played a leading role in establishing democracy in greece during metapolitefsi . he is described as both prudent and a <unk> , despite his appearance as a leftist <unk> , and charismatic <unk> . his choices to remain in the european union and nato , both of which he <unk> opposed for many years , proved his pragmatic approach . even his approach of negotiating the removal of the us bases from greece was diplomatic , because although it was agreed to remove them , some of the bases remained . his skillful handling of these difficult policies had the effect of providing common policy goals to the political forces of greece . <unk> this political realism , andreas ' ability to publicly say no to the americans gave greeks a sense of national independence and psychological <unk> . perhaps his most important achievement was the establishment of political equality among greeks ; during his years in power the defeated <unk> of the civil war were no longer treated like <unk> citizens and a vital part of national memory was <unk> 's successor in office , <unk> <unk> , broke with a number of papandreou 's approaches . papandreou 's son , george papandreou , was elected leader of pasok in <month> <year> and prime minister during the <month> <year> general elections . a common slogan among pasok followers in political rallies , <unk> andreas ' legacy with the chant `` andrea , <unk> ! <unk> <unk> <unk> ! '' ( `` andreas , you are still alive ! you 're leading us ! `` ) . in two separate polls , conducted in <year> and <year> , andreas papandreou was voted as the best prime minister of greece since the restoration of democracy in <year> . === theodore katsanevas === until their divorce in <year> , papandreou 's daughter sofia was married to the academic and politician theodore katsanevas . in papandreou 's will , he accused katsanevas of being a `` <unk> to the family '' ( greek : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) and claimed that `` his aim was to politically <unk> the history of struggle of georgios papandreou and andreas papandreou '' . == works == the location and scope of the entrepreneurial function , harvard university , <year> economics and the social sciences , economic journal , <year> an experimental test of an axiom in the theory of choice , econometrica , <year> competition and its regulation , prentice-hall , <year> a test of a stochastic theory of choice , econometrica , <year> economics as a science , <unk> , <year> fundamentals of model construction in <unk> , center of economic research , <year> a strategy for greek economic development , center of economic research , <year> democracy and national rebirth , <unk> , athens , <year> the political element in economic development , <unk> & <unk> , <year> toward a totalitarian world ? , <unk> , stockholm , <year> man 's freedom , columbia university press , new york , <year> democracy at <unk> : the greek front ( i <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , doubleday & co. , new york , <year> <unk> capitalism , the university of minnesota press , <year> economic development - rhetoric and reality , the university of british columbia , vancouver , <year> project selection for national plans , praeger publishers , new york , <year> the impact approach to project selection , praeger publishers , new york , <year> the method of repercussions in investment selection , praeger publishers , new york , <year> <unk> and economic development , athens , <year> greece to the greeks , athens , <year> transition to socialism , athens , <year> mediterranean socialism , <unk> , <unk> , <year> == decorations and awards == knight grand cross of the order of isabella the catholic ( <year> ) order of the polar star ( <year> ) == references == == further reading == <unk> , richard . `` andreas <unk> political profile .

national security council . during the <year>s apartheid era in south africa , he served as an adviser to p. w. botha 's security services . he is best known for his <year> theory , the `` clash of civilizations '' , of a post-cold war new world order . he argued that future wars would be fought not between countries , but between cultures , and that islamic <unk> would become the biggest threat to western domination of the world . huntington is credited with helping to shape american views on <unk> relations , political development , and comparative government . according to the open <unk> project , huntington is the second most frequently cited author on college <unk> for political science courses . == early life and education == huntington was born on <month> <integer> , <year> , in new york city , the son of dorothy <unk> ( née phillips ) , a <unk> writer , and richard thomas huntington , a publisher of hotel trade journals . his grandfather was publisher john <unk> phillips . he graduated with distinction from yale university at age <integer> , served in the us army for a brief period , earned his master 's degree from the university of chicago , and completed his phd at harvard university , where he began teaching at age <integer> . == academic career == huntington was a member of harvard 's department of government from <year> until he was denied tenure in <year>. along with <unk> brzezinski , who had also been denied tenure , he moved to columbia university in new york . from <year> to <year> he was an associate professor of government at columbia , where he was also associate director of their institute of war and peace studies . huntington was invited to return to harvard with tenure in <year> and remained there until his death . he was elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in <year>. huntington and warren <unk> <unk> co-founded and co-edited foreign policy . huntington stayed as co-editor until <unk> 's first major book was the soldier and the state : the theory and politics of civil-military relations ( <year> ) , which was highly controversial when it was published , but <unk> is regarded as the most influential book on american civil-military relations . he became prominent with his political order in changing societies ( <year> ) , a work that challenged the conventional opinion of modernization theorists , that economic and social progress would produce stable democracies in recently <unk> countries . he also was co-author of the crisis of democracy : on the <unk> of democracies , a report issued by the trilateral commission in <year>. in <year> , his friend brzezinski – who had been appointed national security adviser in the administration of jimmy carter – invited huntington to become white house coordinator of security planning for the national security council . he served in this position until the end of <year> . huntington continued to teach <unk> until his retirement in <year> . ==

years of declining health , huntington died on <month> <integer> , <year> , at age <integer> on martha 's vineyard , massachusetts . == notable arguments == === the soldier and the state === in the soldier and the state : the theory and politics of civil-military relations ( <year> ) huntington presents a general theory of <unk> relations . huntington proposes a theory of objective civilian control , according to which the optimal means of <unk> control over the armed forces is to <unk> them . === political order in changing societies === during <year> , just as the united states ' war in vietnam was becoming most intense , huntington published political order in changing societies , which was a critique of the modernization theory which had affected much us policy regarding the developing world during the prior decade . huntington argues that as societies <unk> , they become more complex and <unk> . if the process of social modernization that produces this disorder is not matched by a process of political and institutional <unk> process which produces political institutions capable of managing the stress of <unk> result <month> be violence . during the <year>s , huntington was an advisor to governments , both democratic and <unk> . during <year> , he met with <unk> government representatives in brazil ; a year later he published the report `` approaches to political <unk> '' , warning against the risks of a <unk> political liberalization , proposing gradual liberalization , and a strong party state <unk> upon the image of the mexican institutional revolutionary party . after a prolonged transition , brazil became democratic during <year> . during the <year>s , he became a valued adviser to the south african regime , which used his ideas on political order to craft its `` total strategy '' to reform apartheid and suppress growing resistance . he assured south africa 's rulers that increasing the <unk> power of the state ( which at that time included police violence , <unk> without trial , and torture ) can be necessary to effect reform . the reform process , he told his south african audience , often requires `` <unk> , <unk> , <unk> assumptions and purposeful <unk> . '' he thus gave his <unk> to his <unk> ' project of `` reforming '' apartheid rather than eliminating <unk> frequently cited brazil as a success , <unk> to his role in his <year> presidential address to the american political science association , commenting that political science played a modest role in this process . critics , such as british political scientist alan hooper , note that contemporary brazil has an especially unstable party system , <unk> the best <unk> party , <unk> <unk> <unk> da silva 's workers ' party , emerged in opposition to controlled transition . moreover , hooper claims that the lack of civil participation in contemporary brazil results from that <unk> process of political participation transitions . === the third wave === in his <year> book the third wave : democratization in the late twentieth century , huntington made the argument that beginning with portugal 's revolution during <year> , there has been a third wave of democratization which describes a global trend which includes more than <integer> countries throughout europe , latin america , asia , and africa which have undergone some form of democratic transition . huntington won the <year> university of louisville <unk> award for this book . === `` the clash of civilizations '' === during <year> , huntington provoked great debate among international relations theorists with the <unk> titled `` the clash of civilizations ? `` , an influential , <unk> article published in foreign affairs magazine . in the article , he argued that , after the fall of the soviet union , <unk> would become the biggest <unk> to western domination of the world . the west 's next big war therefore , he said , would inevitably be with <unk> . its description of post-cold war <unk> and the `` <unk> of instability '' contrasted with the influential `` end of history '' thesis advocated by francis <unk> . huntington expanded `` the clash of civilizations ? '' to book length and published it as the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order in <year>. the article and the book <unk> that post-cold war conflict would most frequently and <unk> occur because of cultural rather than ideological differences . that , whilst in the cold war , conflict occurred between the capitalist west and the communist bloc east , it now was most likely to occur between the world 's major <unk> seven , and a possible eighth : ( i ) western , ( ii ) latin american , ( iii ) islamic , ( iv ) <unk> ( chinese ) , ( v ) hindu , ( vi ) orthodox , ( <unk> ) japanese , and ( viii ) african . this cultural organization <unk> the contemporary world with the classical notion of <unk> states . to understand current and future conflict , cultural <unk> must be understood , and <unk> than the <unk> be accepted as the reason for war . thus , western nations will lose <unk> if they fail to recognize the <unk> nature of cultural tensions . huntington argued that this post-cold war shift in <unk> organization and structure requires the west to strengthen itself culturally , by abandoning the imposition of its ideal of democratic <unk> and its <unk> military <unk> . <unk> this point , huntington wrote in the <year> expansion , `` in the emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash , western belief in the <unk> of western culture suffers three problems : it is false ; it is immoral ; and it is dangerous . `` the identification of western civilization with western christianity ( <unk> ) was not huntington 's original idea , it was rather the traditional western opinion and <unk> before the cold war era . critics ( for example articles in le monde <unk> ) call the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order the theoretical <unk> of <unk> western aggression against china and the world 's islamic and orthodox cultures . other critics argue that huntington 's taxonomy is <unk> and arbitrary , and does not take account of the internal dynamics and partisan tensions within civilizations . furthermore , critics argue that huntington <unk> ideological mobilization by elites and <unk> socioeconomic needs of the population as the real causal factors driving conflict , that he <unk> conflicts that do not fit well with the civilizational borders identified by him , and they charge that his new paradigm is nothing but <unk> thinking in which `` states '' became replaced by `` civilizations '' . huntington 's influence upon us policy has been likened to that of historian arnold <unk> 's controversial religious theories about asian leaders during the early twentieth century . the new york times obituary on huntington states that his `` emphasis on ancient religious empires , as opposed to states or <unk> , [ as sources of global conflict ] gained ... more <unk> after the <unk> <integer> attacks . `` huntington wrote that ukraine might divide along the cultural line between the more catholic western ukraine and orthodox eastern ukraine : while a <unk> approach <unk> the possibility of a <unk> war , a civilizational approach <unk> that and instead <unk> the possibility of ukraine <unk> in half , a separation which cultural factors would lead one to predict might be more violent than that of czechoslovakia but far less bloody than that of yugoslavia . === who are we and immigration === huntington 's last book , who are we ?

( ; <month> <integer> , <year> – <month> <integer> , <year> ) was an american economist and political scientist who taught at the university of maryland , college park . his most influential contributions were in institutional economics , and in the role which private property , taxation , public goods , collective action , and contract rights play in economic development . == education and career == olson graduated from north <unk> state university , and was a rhodes scholar at university college , oxford before he earned a phd in economics from harvard in <year> . his first job was as an assistant professor at princeton university . afterwards , he served as deputy assistant secretary of health , education and welfare for two years in washington , d.c. in <year> he left government and joined the economics department of the university of maryland , college park , where he remained until his death . == legacy == === academic work === in his first book , the logic of collective action : public goods and the theory of groups ( <year> ) , he theorized that what <unk> people to act in groups is incentive ; members of large groups do not act in accordance with a common interest unless motivated by personal gain ( economic , social , <unk> ) . while small groups can act on shared objectives , large groups will not work towards shared objectives unless their individual members are sufficiently <unk> <year> , he expanded the scope of his earlier work in an attempt to explain the rise and decline of nations ( <year> ) . he argues that groups such as cotton farmers , steel producers , and labor unions have an incentive to form lobby groups and influence policies in their favor . these policies will tend to be <unk> , which will <unk> economic growth ; but because the benefits of such policies are concentrated , and their costs are <unk> throughout the whole population , there will be little public resistance to them . as <unk> coalitions <unk> , nations <unk> by them will fall into economic decline . his work influenced the formulation of the <unk> hypothesis of collective <unk> his final book , power and prosperity ( <year> ) , olson distinguished between the economic effects of different types of government , in particular , <unk> , <unk> , and democracy . olson argued that under <unk> , a `` roving bandit '' only has the incentive to <unk> and destroy , whilst a `` stationary bandit '' <unk> <unk> an incentive to encourage some degree of economic success as he <unk> to remain in power long enough to benefit from that success . a stationary bandit thereby begins to take on the governmental function of protecting citizens and their property against roving bandits . in the move from roving to stationary bandits , olson sees the seeds of civilization , <unk> the way , eventually for democracy , which by giving power to those who <unk> with the wishes of the population , <unk> incentives for good government . olson 's work on the roving vs. stationary bandits is influential in analysis of the political and economic order structured in <unk> states and societies . === policy work === to help bring his ideas to the attention of policymakers , olson founded the center for institutional reform in the informal sector ( `` <unk> center '' ) , funded by usaid ( united states agency for international development ) . based at the university of maryland , the center sought to supply an intellectual foundation for legal and economic reform projects carried out by usaid in formerly communist states that were attempting to make the transition to <unk> democratic governments governed by the rule of law . it was particularly active in east and central europe and the former soviet union . the center also became actively involved in projects in south america , africa , and asia , where it became a proponent of judicial independence . it sponsored the first conference on corruption in <unk> africa in the <year>s , when it was a very sensitive subject . the <unk> center continued to operate after olson 's death , but was eventually <unk> into other programs at the university of maryland . to honor olson 's many contributions , the american political science association established the olson award for the best phd dissertation in political economy . in <year> the university of maryland announced the creation of a new endowed <unk> mancur olson professor of economics . maryland professor of economics peter <unk> was the first mancur olson professor . == selected works == === books === the logic of collective action : public goods and the theory of groups . cambridge , ma : harvard university press . <year>. isbn <unk> . the <unk> society . new york , ny : norton . <year>. isbn <unk> . a new approach to the economics of health care . washington , d.c. : american enterprise institute for public policy research . <year>. isbn <unk> . the rise and decline of nations : economic growth , stagflation , and social <unk> . new haven : yale university press . <year>. isbn <unk> . a <unk> science : a broader view of economies and societies . oxford ;

later , during the brezhnev era , he became head of the financial department of the state planning committee . pavlov was appointed to the post of chairman of the state committee on prices during the gorbachev era , and later became minister of finance in nikolai ryzhkov 's second government . he went on to succeed ryzhkov as head of government in the newly established post of prime minister of the soviet union . as prime minister pavlov initiated the <year> soviet monetary reform , commonly referred to as the pavlov reform , in early <year>. early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of soviet <unk> transported to the soviet union from abroad . although ridiculed at the time , the statement was later proven to be true . in <month> the same year , pavlov called for a transfer of power from the president of the soviet union to the prime minister and the cabinet of ministers . when that failed , he joined a plot to oust gorbachev . in <month> , he participated in the <year> soviet coup d'état attempt , which tried to prevent the <unk> of the soviet union . pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-soviet russia . he is seen by some as the last <unk> soviet head of government since his successor , ivan silayev , was appointed by the russian soviet federative socialist republic in breach of what his opponents consider to be soviet constitutional principles . == early life and career == born in moscow on <integer> <month> <year> , pavlov graduated from the moscow finance institute in <year>. he started his <unk> ( bureaucratic ) career as a government economist ; he started working for as an official of the ministry of finance in <year> , and became a member of the communist party of the soviet union in <year>. early in his career he also worked for the ministry of finance of the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( rsfsr ) . pavlov started working for the state planning committee in <year> , and became a member of the state planning committee 's board in <year>. he held the office as head of the state planning committee 's finance department , the department which oversaw all aspects of the country 's planned economy . he served as first deputy minister of finance in boris gostev 's ministry from <month> to <month> <unk> was appointed chairman of the state committee on prices on <integer> <month> <year> , and retained that post until <integer> <month> <year>. throughout the period , and later as minister of finance , pavlov supported the centralised price reform proposal posited by nikolai ryzhkov , chairman of the council of ministers . he succeeded gostev to become minister of finance in ryzhkov 's government in <year> and his time in the post was considered <unk> , even though lira <unk> , deputy chairman of the state committee for prices , was not elected to the post of chairman of the state committee for her advocacy of <unk> plans for centrally administered price reform . he was the only minister in ryzhkov 's government who was also a member of the presidium of the council of <unk> with eduard <unk> – soviet foreign minister – pavlov was the only nominee from ryzhkov 's second government to be <unk> elected by the supreme soviet of the soviet union . as minister of finance , pavlov was supportive of the <unk> of the soviet economy , having <unk> a rapid increase in the soviet money supply and the increase in inflation it caused . pavlov also set the exchange rate for the rouble against the american dollar on the soviet black market . in <year> he <unk> admitted that during his tenure as minister of finance , and later prime minister , he had <unk> several western banks and <unk> by lying about the soviet union 's gold reserves . in <year> , pavlov gathered together enough information on the errors and <unk> of ivan silayev , the future soviet premier and russian <unk> premier , to <unk> his position as deputy premier . silayev never <unk> pavlov and relations between the two grew even more <unk> when pavlov became soviet premier . == prime minister == following the resignation of nikolai ryzhkov following a heart attack in <month> <year> , pavlov was elected to the new position of prime minister as a compromise candidate , and became chairman of the cabinet of ministers . he and his two first deputy prime ministers , vladimir <unk> and vitaly <unk> , were approved and elected by the supreme soviet of the soviet union on <integer> <month> , with <integer> votes in favour , <integer> against , and <integer> <unk> , while approval for the majority of his ministers followed within a few weeks . pavlov was considered a conservative upon his election as prime minister , and the soviet press described him as a `` bold and complex man '' who was against full <unk> but who believed that the soviet union was even more oppressive towards workers than even the most advanced capitalist societies . one of his first actions as prime minister was to move the headquarters of the soviet government – the cabinet of ministers – from the moscow kremlin to the former headquarters of the state committee for construction to strengthen his position . === <year> monetary reform === the soviet monetary reform of <year> , commonly referred to as the pavlov reform , was the last monetary reform prior to the dissolution of the soviet union , despite having made a speech <integer> weeks before , saying there would be no such reforms . initiated on <integer> <month> <year> , it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for <unk> to the production of consumer goods , which were in short supply . in a speech , pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government 's belief that money was being sent to the soviet union from abroad , <unk> inflation . although ridiculed by the soviet press at the time , three years later the truth of pavlov 's statement was verified . mikhail gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in <year>. the directive also included <unk> and <unk> banknotes issued in <year>. on <integer> <month> <year> , the government began <unk> monthly bank <unk> <unk> to <integer> rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials , <unk> and <unk> the orders of pavlov , the government <unk> forty percent of prices on <integer> <month> <year> , and introduced sales tax of <integer> % . prices of consumer goods , in particular , were now considered free in the sense that negotiation became possible between producers and the <unk> . according to philip hanson in his book , the rise and fall of the soviet economy : an economic history of the ussr from <year> , pavlov 's reform was <unk> by the union republics who failed to follow pavlov 's orders , along with the widespread existence of local <unk> , which tended to have their own definition of luxury goods and as a result imposed higher prices on such <unk> citizens had only three days from <integer> to <integer> <month> to exchange their old <integer> rouble and <integer> rouble banknotes for the new currency . exchange could be <unk> , but only through specialized government commissions . due to this short exchange window , long <unk> formed in front of soviet savings banks , even though it was also possible to exchange money at <unk> and post offices . this reform also dealt a <unk> blow to soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged ; some lost as much as <other>5,000 - <other>0,000 rubles <unk> the end the reform proved unsuccessful . the government only managed to withdraw <integer> billion rubles from circulation of the country 's money supply against an intended target of <decimal> billion rubles . as a result , the pavlov reform did not put an end to inflation . prices for items including food and transport rose by <unk> percent , while the soviet standard of living decreased sharply and the state budget deficit increased by an estimated <unk> percent of gnp . in the aftermath of the reform , inflation exceeded the <integer> percent mark every month . === coup attempt === in <month> <year> , pavlov , who felt that the office of prime minister had limited power , discovered that gorbachev planned to replace him as prime minister . in response , he arrived at the supreme soviet of the soviet union `` visibly nervous '' , and in his report to the supreme soviet , he was forced to tell delegates of the <unk> state of the soviet economy . however , pavlov blamed this on the ongoing war of laws between the supreme soviet of the soviet union and the supreme soviet of the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( rsfsr ) , which , he argued , could be resolved by introducing a state of emergency across the entire soviet union , or at least in certain economic <unk> to pavlov , the union 's problems remained <unk> as long as gorbachev retained so much power and had limited time to address important issues . to break the <unk> , pavlov called for a transfer of power from the president of the soviet union to the prime minister and the cabinet of ministers , ( specifically , he wanted the cabinet to have the right to issue <unk> on economic affairs without the approval of the president ) , even creating a <unk> resolution to that end for the <unk> to consider . pavlov received support for the idea from the soyuz parliamentary <unk> leader viktor <unk> , who called for an immediate vote on the issue . however , several members of soyuz also demanded a statement by the kgb and the ministry of defence to comment on the proposal . in retrospect , <unk> notes that this resolution could have become a coup d'état had pavlov consulted with them earlier . according to historian jerry f. <unk> , pavlov 's program `` was not directed as much at gorbachev as at [ boris ] yeltsin '' <unk> the afternoon , the majority of soyuz members favoured an immediate vote . the chairman of the supreme soviet of the soviet union , anatoly <unk> , had already departed for novo <unk> to take part in constitutional negotiations and he promised to tell gorbachev about the vote . in his place stood ivan <unk> , a <unk> reformer , who did not trust <unk> and tried to <unk> the vote by demanding a statement from the kgb , ministry of the interior and the ministry of defence . according to <unk> , the mood was such that if a vote had been taken pavlov would have won . at the time , both the soviet secret police and the military establishment in general wanted to strengthen the authority of the soviet government and so they too supported pavlov 's program . soyuz , through a vote , was able to increase the powers of the cabinet of ministers , and gave the institution the right of legislative <unk> afterwards , jack <unk> , united states ambassador to the soviet union , told gorbachev of the possibility of a coup attempt against him , and the soviet leader became worried when anatoly <unk> informed him of <unk> troop movements outside moscow . on <integer> <month> , four days after pavlov 's speech , gorbachev addressed the supreme soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and pavlov . even when he had been able to secure his position , gorbachev 's power within the system was already <unk> , although he succeeded in getting the <unk> powers previously given to the cabinet of ministers reversed . the power struggle between gorbachev and pavlov was not over , with gorbachev , on <month> <integer> , <year> , promising yeltsin and <unk> nazarbayev that pavlov , along with dmitry <unk> , minister of defence , and vladimir kryuchkov , the chairman of the kgb , would be removed from their posts following the signing and <unk> of the new union treaty , with nazarbayev to be appointed in pavlov 's place as prime minister . === <month> coup === the <year> soviet coup d'état attempt , commonly referred to as the <month> coup , was prompted by the slow <unk> of the soviet union that resulted from gorbachev 's reform policy and yeltsin 's drive towards an independent russia . the new union treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics , which weakened the government 's already <unk> hold on the economy . pavlov received a draft of the new union treaty on <integer> <month> at a security council meeting and managed to get it published in the moscow news on <integer> <unk> the decentralisation stance taken in the treaty , pavlov was one of the key players in the establishment of the state committee for the state of emergency in <month> <year>. pavlov 's inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its <unk> to <unk> to <unk> policies . the committee 's main goal was to ensure that the soviet union continued as a highly centralised union state . the emergency committee was led by <unk> <unk> , vice president of the soviet union , interior minister boris <unk> , defence minister dmitry <unk> and other <unk> who were determined to take action to oust <unk> kryuchkov , the kgb chairman , had told pavlov of the coup on <integer> <month> , one day before it began . he was asked by kryuchkov to meet his <unk> at the moscow kremlin , where on <integer> <month> , he and his <unk> appeared on live television and told the soviet people that gorbachev was <unk> . as the day wore on it soon became apparent that pavlov had been drinking since he issued several contradictory orders and repeated himself . in retrospect he admitted that he had been drinking with his son the day before . on the same day , his fellow plotters decided to <unk> pavlov , sending him to his <unk> where his wife took care of him . as with all the others , pavlov was arrested following the collapse of the coup . shortly after pavlov was <unk> with <unk> whilst remaining in custody . he was released on <unk> not to leave in <month> <year> and granted amnesty by the russian state duma in <year> . == later life and death == after his release from custody , pavlov became a director of the commercial bank <unk> between <year> and <year>. he resigned at the request of the bank 's board of directors , who informed him that they had decided `` to provide him an <unk> leave of absence . '' in <month> <year> , shortly after his resignation , the bank 's license was <unk> for <unk> the banking laws set up by the central bank of russia . pavlov then worked as an advisor to <unk> between <year> and <year> , and in <year> also became a vice president of the american firm business management systems . he worked both as vice president of both the free economic society and the international academy of management and later headed a department of the international union of economists . pavlov died in moscow on <integer> <month> <year> , and was buried on <integer> <month> at
