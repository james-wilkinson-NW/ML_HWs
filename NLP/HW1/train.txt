'' kukrit accepted , saying , according to englund , `` we are all actors <unk> , and i think you 're right that i could play it better than anyone .

welfare economics ; capital ; finance , particularly the <unk> hypothesis ; public finance , particularly optimal allocation ; international economics , particularly the balassa–samuelson effect and the <unk> model ; macroeconomics , particularly the overlapping generations model ; and market economics . == biography == samuelson was born in gary , indiana , on <month> <integer> , <year> , to frank samuelson , a <unk> , and <unk> née <unk> . his family , he later said , was `` made up of <unk> mobile jewish immigrants from poland who had <unk> considerably in world war i , because gary was a brand new <unk> when my family went there '' . in <year> , samuelson moved to chicago where he graduated from hyde park high school ( now hyde park career academy ) . he then studied at the university of chicago and received his bachelor of arts degree there in <year>. he said he was born as an economist , at <unk> on <month> <integer> , <year> , in the university of chicago classroom . the lecture mentioned as the cause was on the british economist thomas <unk> , who most famously studied population growth and its effects . samuelson felt there was a <unk> between neoclassical economics and the way the system seemed to behave ; he said henry simons and frank knight were a big influence on him . he next completed his master of arts degree in <year> , and his doctor of philosophy in <year> at harvard university . he won the david a. wells prize in <year> for writing the best doctoral dissertation at harvard university in economics , for a thesis titled `` foundations of analytical economics '' , which later turned into foundations of economic analysis . as a graduate student at harvard , samuelson studied economics under joseph schumpeter , <unk> leontief , <unk> <unk> , and the `` american keynes '' alvin hansen . samuelson moved to mit as an assistant professor in <year> and remained there until his <unk> 's family included many well-known economists , including brother robert summers , <unk> anita summers , brother-in-law kenneth arrow and nephew larry summers . during his seven decades as an economist , samuelson 's professional positions included : assistant professor of economics at mit , <year> ; associate professor , <year> . member of the radiation laboratory <unk> . professor of international economic relations ( part-time ) at the <unk> school of law and diplomacy in <year> . guggenheim fellowship from <year> to <year> professor of economics at mit beginning in <year> and institute professor beginning in <year> . vernon f. taylor visiting distinguished professor at trinity university ( texas ) in spring <year> . === death === samuelson died after a brief illness on <month> <integer> , <year> , at the age of <decimal> his death was announced by the massachusetts institute of technology . james m. poterba , an economics professor at mit and the president of the national bureau of economic research , commented that samuelson `` leaves an immense legacy , as a researcher and a teacher , as one of the giants on whose shoulders every contemporary economist stands '' . susan <unk> , the president of mit , said that samuelson `` transformed everything he <unk> : the theoretical foundations of his field , the way economics was taught around the world , the ethos and stature of his department , the investment practices of mit , and the lives of his colleagues and students '' . == fields of interest == as professor of economics at the massachusetts institute of technology , samuelson worked in many fields , including : consumer theory , where he pioneered the revealed preference approach , which is a method by which one can <unk> a consumer 's utility function , by observing their behavior . rather than <unk> a utility function or a preference ordering , samuelson imposed conditions directly on the choices made by individuals – their preferences as revealed by their choices . welfare economics , in which he popularised the <unk> conditions ( criteria for deciding whether an action will improve welfare ) and demonstrated in <year> the <unk> of a <unk> index to reveal which of two social options was <unk> outside the other 's ( feasible ) possibility function ( collected scientific papers , v. <integer> , ch . <integer> ;

'' samuelson strongly criticised friedman and friedrich von hayek arguing their opposition to state intervention `` tells us something about them rather than something about <unk> khan or franklin roosevelt . it is <unk> to <unk> against inevitable <unk> <unk> ... once individual commercial freedoms are in any way <unk> upon . '' == impact == samuelson is considered one of the founders of <unk> economics and a seminal figure in the development of neoclassical economics . in awarding him the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences the committee stated : more than any other contemporary economist , samuelson has helped to raise the general analytical and methodological level in economic science . he has simply rewritten considerable parts of economic theory . he has also shown the fundamental unity of both the problems and analytical techniques in economics , partly by a systematic application of the methodology of maximization for a broad set of problems . this means that samuelson 's contributions range over a large number of different fields . he was also essential in creating the neoclassical synthesis , which ostensibly incorporated keynesian and neoclassical principles and still <unk> current mainstream economics . in <year> , samuelson was one of the ten nobel <unk> economists signing the economists ' statement opposing the bush tax cuts . == <unk> and quotations == <unk> <unk> once challenged samuelson to name one theory in all of the social sciences that is both true and <unk> . several years later , samuelson responded with david ricardo 's theory of comparative advantage : `` that it is <unk> true need not be argued before a mathematician ; that is not <unk> is <unk> by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them . `` for many years , samuelson wrote a column for newsweek . one article included samuelson 's most quoted remark and a favorite economics <unk> : to prove that wall street is an early <unk> of movements still to come in gnp , commentators quote economic studies <unk> that market <unk> predicted four out of the last five recessions . that is an <unk> . wall street <unk> predicted nine out of the last five recessions ! and its mistakes were <unk> . in the early editions of his famous , <unk> economics textbook paul samuelson <unk> that gdp falls when a man `` <unk> his maid '' . == publications == === foundations of economic analysis === paul samuelson 's book foundations of economic analysis ( <year> ) is considered his magnum opus . it is derived from his doctoral dissertation , and was inspired by the classical thermodynamic methods . the book proposes to : examine underlying <unk> between central features in theoretical and applied economics and study how <unk> meaningful theorems can be derived with a small number of analogous methods ( p. <integer> ) , in order to derive `` a general theory of economic theories '' ( samuelson , <year> , p. <unk> ) . the book showed how these goals could be <unk> and <unk> achieved , using the language of the mathematics applied to diverse <unk> of economics . the book proposes two general hypotheses as sufficient for its purposes : maximizing behavior of agents ( including consumers as to utility and business firms as to profit ) and economic systems ( including a market and an economy ) in stable <unk> the first tenet , his views presented the idea that all actors , whether firms or consumers , are striving to maximize something . they could be attempting to maximize profits , utility , or wealth , but it did not matter because their efforts to improve their well-being would provide a basic model for all actors in an economic system . his second tenet was focused on providing insight on the <unk> of equilibrium in an economy . generally in a market , supply would equal demand . however , he urged that this might not be the case and that the important thing to look at was a system 's natural resting point . foundations presents the question of how an equilibrium would <unk> when it is moved from its optimal point . samuelson was also influential in providing <unk> on how the changes in certain factors can affect an economic system . for example , he could explain the economic effect of changes in taxes or new technologies . in the course of analysis , comparative statics , ( the analysis of changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a <unk> change of the system ) is <unk> and clearly stated . the chapter on welfare economics `` attempt ( s ) to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics '' ( samuelson , <year> , p. <integer> ) . it also <unk> on and develops what became commonly called the <unk> social welfare function . it shows how to represent ( in the maximization calculus ) all <unk> economic measures of any belief system that is required to rank consistently different feasible social <unk> in an ethical sense as `` better than '' , `` worse than '' , or `` indifferent to '' each other ( p. <integer> ) . === economics === samuelson is also author ( and since <year> co-author ) of an influential principles textbook , economics , first published in <year> ( <days> ed . as of <year> ; multiple <unk> ) . the book sold more than <other>00,000 copies of each edition from <year> through <year> and was translated in the <unk> languages . as of <year> , it has sold over four million copies . william nordhaus joined as co-author on the <days> edition ( <year> ) . sometime before <year> , it had become the best-selling economics textbook of all <unk> was once quoted as saying , `` let those who will write the nation 's laws if i can write its textbooks . '' written in the shadow of the great depression and the second world war , it helped to popularize the insights of john <month>nard keynes . a main focus was how to avoid , or at least <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in economic activity . samuelson wrote : `` it is not too much to say that the widespread creation of <unk> and the resulting world war ii stemmed in no small measure from the world 's failure to meet this basic economic problem [ the great depression ] <unk> . '' this reflected the concern of keynes himself with the economic causes of war and the importance of economic policy in promoting <unk> 's book was the second to introduce keynesian economics to a wide audience , and was by far the most successful . canadian economist lorie tarshis , who had been a student attending keynes 's lectures at harvard in the <year>s , published in <year> an introductory textbook that incorporated his lecture notes , titled elements of economics . === other publications === there are <integer> papers in samuelson 's collected scientific papers . stanley fischer ( <year> , p. <integer> ) writes that taken together they are `` unique in their <unk> , breadth of economic and general knowledge , mastery of setting , and <unk> of <unk> to predecessors '' . samuelson was co-editor , along with william a. barnett , of inside the economist 's mind : conversations with eminent economists ( blackwell publishing , <year> ) , a collection of interviews with notable economists of the <days> century . == criticisms == === textbook influences in higher education === samuelson 's textbook was a <unk> in introducing a serious study of business cycles in the economics curriculum . it was particularly timely because it followed the great depression , which had only ended because of the fiscal stimulus of world war ii . the study of business cycles along with the introduction of the keynesian approach of aggregate demand set the stage for the macroeconomic revolution in america , which then <unk> throughout the world through translations into every major language . generations of students , who then became teachers , learned their first and most influential lessons from samuelson 's economics . it attracted many <unk> , who became successful in different niches of the college market . the text was not without criticism . while it praised the `` mixed economy '' of market and government , some found that too radical and attacked it as socialist . as a precursor to criticisms of samuelson 's economics textbook , lorie tarshis 's textbook was attacked by trustees of , and <unk> to , american colleges and universities as <unk> a `` socialist <unk> '' . <unk> on , william f. buckley , jr. , in his <year> book , god and man at yale , devoted an entire chapter , attacking both samuelson 's and tarshis ' textbooks . for samuelson 's book , buckley drew from the educational <unk> and credited it as an `` excellent review of samuelson 's text . '' ( `` note to chapter two .

'' ( `` note to chapter two . '' p. <integer> ) buckley essentially characterized both as – in the words of paul davidson – `` communist inspired '' . buckley , for the rest of his life , defended the criticisms set forth in his book . === economic growth of ussr === one criticism – of a concept that samuelson added to his economics textbook – was the comparison of usa growth rates with those of the ussr , which , according to the criticism , was inconsistent with historical gnp differences . the textbook 's <year> edition ( <days> ed . ) <unk> ( projects ) the possibility of <unk> real gnp parity between <year> and <year>. each subsequent edition <unk> a date range further in the future until those graphs were dropped from the <year> edition ( <days> ed . ) . === phillips curve === samuelson , together with robert solow , helped develop and popularize the mathematics of the phillips curve . the curve suggested that unemployment and inflation were <unk> related ; with the <unk> of stagflation in the <year>s some economists including milton friedman and friedrich hayek attacked the economics based on the phillips curve as questionable or <unk> . == memberships == member of the american academy of arts and sciences , national academy of sciences , fellow of royal society of london fellow of the american philosophical society and the british academy ; president ( <year>–68 ) of the international economic association member and past president ( <year> ) of the american economic association member of the editorial board and <unk> ( <year> ) of the econometric society fellow , council member and past vice-president of the royal economic society . member of phi beta kappa . == list of publications == samuelson , paul a .

economics at the university of pennsylvania , mostly known for his contributions to general equilibrium theory . his most famous work was on the <unk> model of economic growth . == biography == david cass was born in <year> in honolulu , hawaii . he earned an a.b . in economics from the university of oregon in <year> and started to study law at the harvard law school as he thought of becoming a lawyer according to family tradition . as he hated studying law he left the program after one year and served in the army from <year> to <year>. he then entered the economics ph.d. program at stanford university . here he met karl shell , although the two began to work together only after both graduated . cass 's doctoral advisor was hirofumi uzawa , who also introduced him to tjalling koopmans , who at that time was a professor at yale university . in <year> , cass graduated with a ph.d. in economics and statistics with a dissertation on optimal growth , with parts of the dissertation later published in the review of economic <unk> graduation cass began to work from <year> to <year> as an assistant professor at the economics department of yale university and as a research associate at the cowles commission for research in economics in new haven . during his time at yale university he collaborated with <unk> yaari and joseph stiglitz and worked mostly on overlapping generations models . in <year> he left new haven for carnegie-mellon university in pittsburgh , where he was a professor of economics until <year>. during his time at carnegie-mellon he began to collaborate with karl shell , who at this time was a professor at the university of pennsylvania . one of his doctoral students was finn e. <unk> , who would later win the nobel prize in economics . in <year> cass left for the university of pennsylvania , where he was a professor of economics until his death . david cass died in <year> in philadelphia after a long illness . he was divorced and the father of two <unk> was a guggenheim fellow in <year> , was an elected fellow of the econometric society since <year> , received an honorary doctorate from the university of geneva in <year> , was a distinguished fellow of the american economic association in <year> and was an elected fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences since <year> . == research == cass made important contributions to pure economic theory , mostly in the field of general equilibrium theory . he made major contributions to the theory of optimal growth , the theory of sunspots and the theory of incomplete markets . he is perhaps best known for his article “ optimum growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation ” , which was a part of his dissertation . in this paper he <unk> a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency in the neoclassical growth model first introduced by frank ramsey . a major difference to the standard ramsey growth model was that cass considered the case where consumption in future periods is discounted , thus <unk> assuming that consumers <unk> consumption today to consumption tomorrow . this modified version of the ramsey growth model is also known as the <unk> model , named after frank ramsey , david cass and tjalling <unk> was also famous for the `` cass criterion '' for overlapping generations models and in the neoclassical growth model , and his work , together with karl shell , on the influence of extrinsic uncertainty on economic equilibria , also known as the concept of sunspot equilibria or the theory of sunspots . together with joseph stiglitz he proved conditions under which it is possible for an investor to achieve an optimal portfolio under the <unk> of being able to buy only two mutual funds . they also showed that generally the demand for money can not be derived from portfolio theory . cass was also a major contributor to the theory of incomplete markets , the turnpike theory and theory of economies with markets that repeatedly open over time . === cass 's scientific works === <unk> cass 's first major contribution to economics was the characterization of optimal growth <unk> in his thesis work under hirofumi uzawa ’ s supervision at stanford university . the celebrated cass criterion for optimal time paths in the one good growth model quickly followed . the essence of this work is the search for price <unk> of efficiency for dynamic time paths , an effort that directly pointed the way to the subsequent full dynamic decentralization of the neoclassical optimal growth model , a fact that <unk> its use for modeling a wide range of business cycle and other macroeconomic phenomena . accordingly , cass is <unk> honored , together with tjalling koopmans and frank ramsey , as one of the fathers of dynamic macroeconomic analysis . the original papers from cass 's thesis were • '' optimum economic growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation , '' published in the review of economic studies in <year> • '' optimum economic growth in the <unk> model of capital accumulation '' • '' optimum economic growth in an aggregative model of capital accumulation : a turnpike theorem , '' published in econometrica in <unk> `` optimum growth ... '' paper was the <unk> of a long line of research ( beginning with frank ramsey 's pioneering research in the <year>s ) on modeling economic growth . the literature found expression in the post-war period in the work of robert solow at mit and hirofumi uzawa at stanford , not only as a theory of growth , but also as a tool for understanding the <unk> . much of the development of the models in the literature was grounded in a set of post-war `` <unk> facts '' that every economics ph.d. student <unk> in their first year of graduate study . one of the weak links in the development of these early models was their specification of saving behavior as being exogenous and given by the empirical regularity of the <unk> relationship , and the various ( partial equilibrium ) theories of consumption spending designed to explain this regularity . cass 's paper was the first to <unk> the <unk> decision by deriving an optimal capital accumulation trajectory that <unk> the discounted sum of utility <unk> over time . the tools that cass used to derive his results were from the <unk> developed field of optimal control in mathematics pioneered by lev <unk> . the main results in the paper are a demonstration that under <unk> assumptions on preferences and technology , the optimal accumulation sequence exists and is unique . the other papers in cass 's thesis drew on the major insights of the `` optimum growth ... '' paper by extending them to show the existence of an optimal growth trajectory in a <unk> model of capital accumulation , and the existence of a so-called turnpike growth path associated with the optimal capital accumulation trajectory in the <unk> model . these papers were published ( possibly even completed ) while cass was a research staff member and then an assistant professor at the cowles foundation at yale university ( <year>–1967 ) . cass was promoted to <unk> associate professor at cowles and remained at yale until <year>. he coauthored several more papers during this time with joseph stiglitz and <unk> yaari , who were also at yale during this period . these included : • '' a <unk> of the pure consumption loans model '' ( with m.e . yaari ) . j pol econ <integer> , <unk> ( <year> ) . • '' individual saving , aggregate capital accumulation and efficient growth '' ( with m.e . yaari ) . essays in the theory of optimal economic growth ( k. shell , ed . ) , mit , <year> . • '' the implications of alternative saving and expectations hypotheses for the choice of techniques and patterns of growth '' ( with j.e . stiglitz ) . j pol econ <integer> , <unk> ( <year> ) . • '' the structure of investor preferences and asset returns , and <unk> in portfolio allocation '' ( with j.e . stiglitz ) . j econ theory <integer> , <unk> ( <year> ) . • '' present values playing the role of efficiency prices in the <unk> growth model '' ( with m.e . yaari ) . rev econ studies <integer> , <unk> ( <year> ) .in the spear and wright macroeconomic dynamics interview with cass , he indicates that his work with <unk> yaari at yale constituted his introduction to samuelson 's consumption loans ( now overlapping generations ) model , which would come front and center as a major <unk> model in cass 's subsequent work with karl shell on sunspot equilibria . during this time , cass also looked more deeply at the question of how individual saving behavior and efficient growth were related . the paper on present values as efficiency prices that cass co-authored with yaari is easily seen to be a precursor of his subsequent work at carnegie mellon on capital overaccumulation and efficiency which led to the famous cass criterion for determining <unk> . finally , cass 's work with stiglitz on modeling investor preferences and asset returns provided a foundation for his later work on financial general equilibrium . cass left yale in <year> , describing himself as part of yale 's `` junior <unk> . '' he was recruited by dick <unk> , then dean of the graduate school of industrial administration at carnegie mellon university . during his time at gsia , cass completed the work on capital overaccumulation , continued his work with joe stiglitz on asset pricing , and began work exploring the general <unk> of the mathematical techniques he had used in his thesis ( mathematical programming , <unk> and the hamiltonian approach to dynamic control ) . the papers produced during this period included : • '' on capital overaccumulation in the aggregative , neoclassical model of economic growth : a complete characterization , '' j econ theory <integer> , <unk> ( <year> ) . • '' <unk> inefficient competitive growth paths : a note on capital overaccumulation and rapidly diminishing future value of consumption in a fairly general model of <unk> production .

'' paper published in the journal of political economy in <year>. much of the work leading up to this paper focused on the overlapping generations model : • '' the role of money in supporting the pareto optimality of competitive equilibrium in <unk> type models '' ( with m. <unk> and i. <unk> ) . j econ theory <integer> , <unk> ( <year> ) . • '' in defense of a basic approach '' ( with k. shell ) . models of monetary economies ( <unk> . <unk> and n. wallace , eds . ) , federal reserve bank of minneapolis , <year> . • '' existence of competitive equilibrium in a general <unk> model '' ( with y. balasko and k. shell ) . j econ theory <integer> , <unk> ( <year> ) .the first actual model of sunspot equilibrium was produced by shell in an <unk> framework with linear utility functions , which appeared in his `` <unk> et allocation <unk> '' in <year> , as part of the <unk> lecture series in paris ( now published as a <unk> paper in macroeconomic dynamics ) . cass and shell 's <unk> paper presented a simplified , <unk> dynamic model in which one of two sets of agents could trade assets contingent on prices in the second period , while the second set of agents could only trade on the second period spot markets . this captured the friction of restricted participation present in <unk> economies , where some agents ( the newly entering young ) are born into a specific state and can not <unk> themselves against outcomes in the birth state . the paper demonstrated that in static <unk> economies with complete markets , extrinsic uncertainty ( where no fundamentals of the model are stochastic ) can not matter to equilibrium allocations . they then showed that when some agents were restricted in their trades , so that market <unk> was <unk> , sunspots could matter , i.e . there could exist rational expectations equilibria in which equilibrium prices depended on the <unk> of an extrinsic stochastic process . in passing , they made the observation that since the validity of the first welfare theorem <unk> that there could be no sunspot equilibria , a necessary condition for the existence of such equilibria was a violation of the conditions under which the first welfare theorem holds . this observation took on a life of its own as what shell called the philadelphia <unk> theorem : if the first welfare theorem does n't hold , then you can find an economy where sunspots matter . in addition to raising <unk> questions about what the right state space was for dynamic stochastic economies , the notion of sunspot equilibrium raised a number of deep questions about the overall determinacy of economic equilibria and the role of the welfare theorems in the occurrence or <unk> of sunspot equilibria . these questions spawned a large literature on determinacy in dynamic economies in which the welfare theorems broke down . these include overlapping generations models , growth models with <unk> or taxes , and models in which asset markets were incomplete . all were shown to allow the existence of sunspot equilibria . and , in a suitable <unk> of intellectual fate , <unk> have recently begun to explore the question of whether sunspot expectations can provide a more <unk> source of fluctuations in dynamic equilibrium models than the conventional aggregate productivity <unk> . cass ’ s third major contribution to economic theory was his work on general equilibrium with incomplete markets , work which grew out of his exploration of the question of existence of sunspot equilibria in models with incomplete asset markets . cass ’ s <unk> work on existence and determinacy of general equilibrium in models with incomplete asset markets spawned another large literature which has come to be known simply as gei . as an historical note , cass never really liked this terminology , preferring instead to think of these models as ones of general financial equilibrium ( <unk> ) to emphasize the presence of financial assets and the <unk> these introduced . the earliest work on market incompleteness goes back to arrow in the <year>s , diamond in the <unk> ‘ <integer> ’ s and a number of related papers in the finance literature between the late <year>s and early ‘ <integer> ’ s ( geanakoplos provides an excellent survey of this literature ) . the <unk> gei model was formulated by radner in the early <year>s in a paper which also pointed up one of the fundamental <unk> about models with incomplete markets : the possible loss of <unk> in the <unk> of the asset <unk> as prices vary . this potential for <unk> of equilibrium ( which was formally developed in hart ’ s <unk> to existence of equilibrium ) left the literature in <unk> for almost a decade , until cass ’ s work on existence in economies with purely financial assets pointed the way out . as geanakoplos notes suddenly in the middle <year>s the pure theory of gei fell into place . in two provocative and influential papers , cass showed that the existence of equilibrium could be guaranteed if all the assets promise delivery in <unk> money , and he gave an example showing that with such financial assets there could be a multiplicity of equilibrium . almost simultaneously werner also gave a proof of existence of equilibrium with financial assets , and geanakoplos and <unk> showed the same for economies with real assets that promise delivery in the same consumption <unk> first paper that geanakoplos references above appeared initially in <month> <year> as a <unk> working paper . this work was followed very quickly by results showing that the <unk> problem pointed out by hart was not generic , and led ultimately to the generic existence results of <unk> and shafer , and again spawned a new literature looking <unk> at the welfare <unk> of market incompleteness , and <unk> at issues of asset engineering . in the time after this seminal work in gei , cass 's various papers dealt with issues of determinacy of equilibrium ( and the closely related issue of existence of sunspot equilibria ) , and with the optimality of allocations in the presence of sunspots and incomplete asset markets . these papers include : • '' the structure of

<unk> on <month> <integer> , <year>. in <year> , in order to pursue his education , he undertook a perilous voyage to the united states , during which he helped navigate the ship . he studied mechanical engineering at cornell university and graduated in <year>. after a short period in the u.s. army , he enrolled in the graduate program in the engineering mechanics department of the university of michigan . he was granted u.s. citizenship in <year>. also in <year> , he received an m.s . degree . he earned a doctorate in <year> . == career == during the period <year> to <year> , he held the position of instructor in engineering mechanics , and upon receipt of the ph.d. , he was appointed assistant professor at ann arbor . he was promoted <unk> associate professor in <year> and to full professor the following year . he moved to uc berkeley in <year> as professor of engineering science , and played an important role in the establishment of the division of applied mechanics in the department of mechanical engineering here . from <year> to <year> , he served as chairman of the division . from <year> onwards , he held the <unk> and elizabeth hughes chair in mechanical engineering , and in <year> he was advanced to the newly instituted position of professor in the graduate school . he was an active member of many committees of the american society of mechanical engineers ( asme ) . during the period <unk> , he served on the executive committee of the applied mechanics division of the asme , and was chairman of the committee in <year>. for its <unk> anniversary in <year> , naghdi undertook the preparation of a history of the division . from <year> to <year> , he served on the u.s. national committee on theoretical and applied mechanics , and was chairman of the committee in <unk> during the period <year>-1984 , he was a member of the general assembly of the international union of theoretical and applied mechanics . his last appointment was to the asme committee on honors ( <year>–1994 ) , of which he was chairman from <year> to <year> . == contribution to continuum mechanics == naghdi 's work on continuum mechanics extended over a period of more than forty years and encompassed almost all aspects of the mechanical behavior of <unk> and fluids . a <unk> <unk> , he was most strongly attracted by fundamental questions in mechanics , and always sought to treat these at the highest level of <unk> . his work is marked by a penetrating physical intuition combined with a <unk> and mathematical line of thought . he is best known for his research in the areas of shell theory and plasticity , but is also recognized for his contributions to linear and nonlinear <unk> , <unk> , the theory of <unk> rods , the theories of fluid sheets and <unk> , <unk> , mixture theory , and general continuum mechanics . naghdi 's interest in elastic shells and plates dated back to his graduate student days at the university of michigan , where he attended summer lectures in <year> on elastic plates by stephen timoshenko . working along classical lines , naghdi subsequently developed a systematic treatment of elastic shells and plates undergoing small deformations , which was published in <year> . during the <year>s , the modern <unk> in continuum mechanics was gathering momentum . it had started out in the <year>s as an interest in nonlinear elastic materials and <unk> fluids , but quickly spread to <unk> a much broader range of material behavior . naghdi embraced the emerging theoretical developments and began to consider in a new light the mechanics that he had learned from classical authors such as love , <unk> , and <unk> . as regards shell theory , he soon realized that a completely new viewpoint could be taken which would lead to an essential clarification of the subject . this is the theory of the cosserat surface ( named after the early twentieth century french <unk> eugene and francois cosserat ) . basically , the cosserat surface is a mathematical model that <unk> a <unk> structure as a <unk> surface upon which additional independent vector fields are defined . naghdi was able to show that <unk> , momentum , and <unk> momentum could be <unk> to the additional fields in such a way that a set of general dynamical equations for the deformations of shells could be obtained . he was invited to write the article on shells and plates in the handbuch der <unk> . this appeared in <year> ( in vol . <unk> of the handbuch ) and is universally recognized as the definitive treatment of the subject . the cosserat surface is not limited to modeling only solid bodies . as naghdi came to realize in the late <year>s , sheets of water admit the same <unk> treatment as solid shells , but <unk> in respect to <unk> properties . naghdi and his co-authors developed an <unk> theory of fluid surfaces and applied it successfully to a wide variety of problems , including waves on a stream of variable depth , flow past obstacles and boats in lakes . in <year> , r. <unk> <unk> , a phd student of john v. <unk> and paul naghdi , named these equations the <unk> equations . the second major focal area that attracted naghdi from the beginning of his career until the end is the behavior of elastic-plastic materials . by the mid-1950s , a reasonably satisfactory theory of plasticity had been developed for materials undergoing small deformations . naghdi and his <unk> performed a number of experimental studies and also contributed several analytical papers on infinitesimal plasticity . naghdi 's review paper of <year> set forth a comprehensive treatment of the theory of infinitesimal plasticity and is still widely cited . in the early <year>s , naghdi set himself the task of extending plasticity theory to <unk> elastic-plastic materials at finite deformations . this was a formidable challenge , since almost every aspect of the infinitesimal theory had to be changed in order to <unk> large deformations . his <year> plasticity paper with his friend and long-term collaborator <unk> . green is the first systematic treatment of elastic-plastic materials undergoing large deformations . over the next two decades , naghdi continued to work on important aspects of plasticity , and in <year> , thirty years after the publication of his review article on infinitesimal plasticity , he offered an even <unk> critical account of the modern theory . == death == after his long career for over three decades as a professor in the department of mechanical engineering , he <unk> to lung cancer at his home in berkeley , california . he died on <month> <integer> , <year> . == achievements == in recognition of his achievements , naghdi received many prestigious awards . in <year> , he received the university of michigan distinguished faculty award . this was followed in <year> by a john simon guggenheim memorial foundation fellowship . in <year> , he received the george westinghouse award of the american society of engineering education . on two occasions ( <year> and <year> ) , he was appointed a research professor in berkeley 's miller institute for basic research in science , and from <year> he held the <unk> and elizabeth hughes chair in mechanical engineering . for his fundamental contributions to plasticity and to shell theory , he was awarded the timoshenko medal by the asme in <year> , which <unk> placed his name on the list of the top engineering scientists of this century . he was made an honorary member of the asme in <year> , and a member of the national academy of engineering in <year>. in <year> , he was awarded the <unk> medal of the society of engineering science in <year>. he held honorary doctor 's degrees from the national university of ireland ( <year> ) and <unk> <unk> de louvain ( <year> ) . in <year> , he was honored with the berkeley citation . additionally , he was selected by the academic senate

'' the `` national library '' mentioned in these accounts is not specifically identified by name , but at the time the library then known as the <unk> <unk> ( prussian state library ) had that function . situated on unter den <unk> and today known as the berlin state library ( <unk> zu berlin ) , this was the largest scientific library of germany . during the war , most of its collection had been dispersed over some <integer> separate storage places across the country for <unk> . after the war much of the collection was returned to the library . however , a substantial number of volumes which had been sent for storage in the eastern part of the country were never recovered , with <unk> of <unk> volumes destroyed and a further <other>00,000 missing . of these , many ended up in soviet and polish library collections , and in particular at the russian state library in <unk> to documentary sources , the so-called `` berlin affair '' is just one of many legends related to the personality of knorozov . his student ershova exposed it as merely a legend and also reported that documents belonging to knorozov , such as his military <unk> . card , could prove that he did not take part in the battle of berlin and was in a different place at the time , finishing his service in a military unit located near moscow . == <unk> of studies == in the autumn of <year> after world war ii , knorozov returned to moscow state university to complete his undergraduate courses at the department of ethnography . he resumed his research into egyptology , and also undertook comparative cultural studies in other fields such as <unk> . he displayed a particular interest and <unk> for the study of ancient languages and writing systems , especially hieroglyphs , and he also read in medieval japanese and arabic <unk> still an undergraduate at <unk> , knorozov found work at the <unk> . <unk> institute of ethnology and anthropology ( or iea ) , part of the prestigious academy of sciences of the ussr . knorozov 's later research findings would be published by the iea under its <unk> . as part of his <unk> curriculum knorozov spent several months as a member of a field expedition to the central asian soviet republics of the <unk> and turkmen <unk> ( what had formerly been the <unk> <unk> , and would much later become the independent nations of <unk> and <unk> following the <year> <unk> of the soviet union ) . on this expedition his <unk> focus was to study the effects of russian expansionary activities and modern developments upon nomadic ethnic groups , of what was a <unk> frontier world of the soviet <unk> this point the focus of his research had not yet been drawn on the <month>a script . this would change in <year> , when at the <unk> of his professor , knorozov wrote his dissertation on the `` de landa alphabet '' , a record produced by the <days> century spanish bishop diego de landa in which he claimed to have <unk> the spanish alphabet into corresponding <month>a hieroglyphs , based on input from <month>a <unk> . de landa , who during his <unk> to <unk> had <unk> the destruction of all the codices from the <month>a civilization he could find , reproduced his alphabet in a work ( relación de las cosas de <unk> ) intended to justify his actions once he had been placed on trial when recalled to spain . the original document had disappeared , and this work was unknown until <year> when an <unk> copy was discovered in the archives of the spanish royal academy by the french scholar , charles <unk> <unk> de <unk> de landa 's `` alphabet '' seemed to be contradictory and <unk> ( e.g. , multiple variations were given for some of the letters , and some of the symbols were not known in the surviving inscriptions ) , previous attempts to use this as a key for deciphering the <month>a writing system had not been successful . == key research == in <year> , the then <unk> knorozov published a paper which was later to prove to be a seminal work in the field ( <unk> <unk> ’ <unk> ’ <unk> ’ <unk> <unk> , or `` ancient writing of central america '' . ) the general thesis of this paper put forward the observation that early scripts such as ancient egyptian and cuneiform which were generally or formerly thought to be predominantly <unk> or even purely ideographic in nature , in fact contained a significant <unk> component . that is to say , rather than the symbols representing only or mainly whole words or concepts , many symbols in fact represented the sound elements of the language in which they were written , and had <unk> or syllabic elements as well , which if understood could further their decipherment . by this time , this was largely known and accepted for several of these , such as egyptian hieroglyphs ( the decipherment of which was famously commenced by <unk> <unk> in <year> using the <unk> <unk> stone <unk> ) ; however the prevailing view was that <month>an did not have such features . knorozov 's studies in comparative linguistics drew him to the conclusion that the <month>an script should be no different from the others , and that purely <unk> or ideographic scripts did not <unk> 's key insight was to treat the <month>a glyphs represented in de landa 's alphabet not as an alphabet , but rather as a <unk> . he was perhaps not the first to propose a syllabic basis for the script , but his arguments and evidence were the most compelling to date . he maintained that when de landa had commanded of his <unk> to write the equivalent of the spanish letter `` b '' ( for example ) , the <month>a <unk> actually produced the glyph which corresponded to the <unk> , <unk> , as <unk> by de landa . knorozov did not actually put forward many new <unk> based on his analysis , nevertheless he maintained that this approach was the key to understanding the script . in effect , the de landa `` alphabet '' was to become almost the `` <unk> stone '' of <month>an <unk> further critical principle put forward by knorozov was that of <unk> . according to this , <month>an words or <unk> which had the form <unk> ( <unk> ) were often to be represented by two glyphs , each representing a <unk> ( i.e. , <unk> ) . in the reading , the vowel of the second was meant to be ignored , leaving the reading ( <unk> ) as intended . the principle also stated that when choosing the second <unk> glyph , it would be one with an <unk> vowel that matched the vowel of the first glyph <unk> . later analysis has proved this to be largely correct . == critical reactions to his work == upon the publication of this work from a then hardly known scholar , knorozov and his thesis came under some severe and at times <unk> criticism . j. eric s. thompson , the noted british scholar regarded by most as the leading <unk> of his day , led the attack . thompson 's views at that time were <unk> <unk> , and his own large body of detailed research had already <unk> a view that the <month>a inscriptions did not record their actual history , and that the glyphs were founded on ideographic principles . his view was the prevailing one in the field , and many other scholars followed <unk> to michael coe , “ during thompson ’ s lifetime , it was a rare <month>a scholar who <unk> to <unk> ” him on the value of knorozov ’ s contributions or on most other questions . as a result , decipherment of <month>a scripts took much longer than their egyptian or hittite counterparts and could only take off after thompson ’ s demise in <year>.the situation was further complicated by knorozov 's paper appearing during the height of the cold war , and many were able to dismiss his paper as being founded on <unk> <unk> ideology and polemic . indeed , in keeping with the mandatory practices of the time , knorozov 's paper was <unk> by a foreword written by the journal 's editor which contained <unk> and propagandist comments <unk> the <unk> approach by which knorozov had succeeded where western scholarship had failed . however , despite claims to the contrary by several of knorozov 's <unk> , knorozov himself never did include such polemic in his <unk> <unk> with his publications in spite of the criticism and rejection of many <month>anists of the time . he was perhaps <unk> to some extent from the ramifications of peer <unk> , since his position and standing at the institute was not <unk> influenced by criticism from western academics . == progress of decipherment == knorozov further improved his decipherment technique in his <year> monograph `` the writing of the <month>a indians '' and published translations of <month>an manuscripts in his <year> work `` <month>a hieroglyphic manuscripts '' .during the <year>s , other <month>anists and researchers began to expand upon knorozov 's ideas . their further <unk> and examination of the <unk> inscriptions began to indicate that actual <month>a history was recorded in the <unk> inscriptions , and not just <unk> and astronomical information . the <unk> but <unk> scholar tatiana proskouriakoff was foremost in this work , eventually convincing thompson and other <unk> that historical events were recorded in the <unk> early supporters of the <unk> approach championed by knorozov included michael d. coe and david kelley , and whilst initially they were in a clear minority , more and more supporters came to this view as further evidence and research <unk> the rest of the decade and into the next , proskouriakoff and others continued to develop the theme , and using knorozov 's results and other approaches began to piece together some <unk> of the script . a major breakthrough came during the first round table or <unk> <unk> conference at the <month>a site of <unk> in <year> , when using the syllabic approach those present ( mostly ) <unk> what turned out to be a list of former rulers of that particular <month>a <unk> decades saw many further such advances , to the point now where quite a significant portion of the surviving inscriptions can be read . most <month>anists and accounts of the decipherment history <unk> much of the credit to the impetus and insight provided by knorozov 's contributions , to a man who had been able to make important contributions to the understanding of this distant , ancient <unk> retrospect , prof. coe writes that `` yuri knorozov , a man who was far removed from the western scientific establishment and who , prior to the late <year>s , never saw a <month>an <unk> nor touch a real <month>an inscription , had nevertheless , against all odds , “ made possible the modern decipherment of <month>a hieroglyphic writing . ” == later life == knorozov had presented his work in <year> at the international congress of americanists in copenhagen , but in the ensuing years he was not able to travel abroad at all . after diplomatic relations between guatemala and the soviet union were restored in <year> , knorozov was invited by president <unk> <unk> to visit guatemala . president <unk> awarded knorozov the order of the <unk> and knorozov visited several of the major <month>an archaeological sites , including <unk> . the government of mexico awarded knorozov the order of the <unk> eagle , the highest decoration awarded by the mexican state to <unk> , in a ceremony at the mexican embassy in moscow on <month> <integer> , <unk> had broad interests in , and contributed to , other <unk> fields such as archaeology , <unk> , human migration to the <unk> , and the evolution of the mind . however , it is his contributions to the field of <month>a studies for which he is best <unk> his very last years , knorozov is also known to have pointed to a place in the united states as the likely location of <unk> , the <unk> land from <unk> to ancient documents and accounts considered <unk> by a <unk> number of <unk> peoples now living in mexico are said to have <unk> died in saint petersburg on <month> <integer> , <year> , of pneumonia in the <unk> of a city hospital ( his daughter <unk> <unk> <unk> that he died in a regular hospital ward at <integer> am , surrounded by the care of his family during his last days ) , just before he was due to give the tatiana proskouriakoff award lecture at harvard university . == list of publications == an incomplete listing of knorozov 's papers , conference reports and other

relationship to working memory . previously , scientists thought that the higher cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex were beyond the scope of scientific study . goldman-rakic 's research showed that methods employed to study the sensory <unk> could be adapted to the highest order prefrontal cortical areas , revealing the circuit basis for higher cognitive function . because of goldman-rakic , scientists began to better understand the <unk> basis of higher cognitive function , and of such disorders as schizophrenia , alzheimer 's , attention deficit <unk> disorder ( <unk> ) , cerebral palsy , parkinson 's disease , and dementia . she used a multidisciplinary approach , applying biochemical , <unk> , <unk> , anatomical and behavioral techniques to study working memory . she pioneered the first studies of <unk> influences on prefrontal cortical function , research that is critical to our understanding of schizophrenia , <unk> and parkinson 's disease . a review of her

<integer> <month> <year> ) was a british evolutionary biologist who made contributions to ornithology , ecology , and ethology . his <year> book , darwin 's finches , on the finches of the galapagos islands was a landmark work as were his other popular science books on life of the robin and swifts in a tower . he developed what is now known as lack 's principle which explained the evolution of avian clutch <unk> in terms of individual selection as opposed to the competing contemporary idea that they had evolved for the benefit of species ( also known as group selection ) . his pioneering <unk> studies of the living bird helped in changing the nature of ornithology from what was then a <unk> field . he was a longtime director of the edward grey institute of field ornithology at the university of oxford . == education and early life == lack was born in london , the oldest of four children of harry lambert lack md <unk> , who later became president of the british medical association . the name <unk> ' is derived from <unk> ' . his father grew up in a farming family from norfolk and became a leading <unk> , nose and <unk> surgeon at the london hospital . although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced david 's interest . his mother kathleen was the daughter of <unk> col. <unk> <unk> of the indian army . kathleen 's father was scottish and on her mother 's side was part irish , greek and georgian . kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women 's <unk> . at home they organized meetings of the poetry society . david was <unk> at home until seven and then went to the open air school in <unk> 's park before going to the hall , <unk> followed by foster 's school , <unk> and gresham 's school , holt , norfolk . lack was taught biology at gresham 's by <unk> . <unk> and <unk> . <unk> . he went to magdalene college , cambridge and received a ba second class in <year> after studying botany , zoology and geology for part i of the tripos and zoology for part <unk> the age of fifteen , lack lived in a large house in <unk> place , london . the family spent their summers in new <unk> kent where lack became familiar with the local birds especially on <unk> marsh . by the age of nine , he had learnt the names of most birds and had written out an <unk> arranged <unk> . in <year> , lack won the <unk> natural history prize for an essay on `` three birds of <unk> heath '' . in <year> , with an essay on <unk> favourite birds ' he was the national winner of the senior prize ( a silver medal ) in the public school essay competition , organised by the royal society for the protection of birds . david did not wish to follow his father 's profession in medicine and took an interest in zoology . his father then considered entomology which was then the only professional field in zoology and found work for david at the frankfurt museum in the summer of <year>. he spent four months <unk> insects in the <unk> museum and found it “ extremely ” <unk> . he joined the cambridge ornithological club whose members included peter scott , arthur duncan , <unk> serventy , and tom harrisson . his first scientific paper was on the display of <unk> , published in the ibis in <year>. he joined on several expeditions with cambridge researchers including two to the arctic . lack wrote the birds of cambridgeshire ( <year> ) which was published by the cambridge bird club . in this work , he departed from the contemporary style with a distinct <unk> on rare and accidental <unk> received an <unk> . from cambridge university in <year> . == career and research == after cambridge , lack , on the recommendation of julian huxley took up a position as a science mentor at dartington hall school , <unk> from <year> until summer <year> when he took a year off to study bird behaviour on the galapagos islands . in <year> he made his first trip to the united states as a <unk> for a dartington hall student returning to california . here he met joseph <unk> and robert <unk> and gave a talk at the cooper ornithological club . in new york , he met ernst <month>r at the american museum of natural history . he returned via the ss <unk> , only one of about four english speakers on the german ship . he was only in the galapagos for part of that year , starting <month> <year>. with the data that he collected in the galapagos , especially on the finches he went to the united states . <month> to <month> <year> was spent at the california academy of sciences which held a large collection of the finches of galapagos that had been studied earlier by harry <unk> and at ernst <month>r 's home in new jersey . while in the us he made a study of the <unk> blackbird with john t. <unk> . he returned home in <month> <year> , after the outbreak of war . lack published the galapagos finches ( <unk> ) , a study in variation in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were <unk> and due to founder effect and genetic drift . lack 's first major work was the life of the robin , which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at dartington hall school . he examined robin behaviour , song , territory , <unk> and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds . the manuscript was completed in <year> and it went through five editions from <year> to <year>. one of lack 's students at dartington hall was eva <unk> . a colleague who helped in filming some of the <unk> for lack was the geography teacher bill hunter . in <year> lack went to tanganyika on an invitation from r.e . <unk> . lack was committed to <unk> and debated the philosophy even during his dartington days with the founder of the college , leonard knight <unk> . during world war ii lack however served with a british army unit called the army operational research group on the orkney islands working on radar use . during this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including george <unk> , an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of <unk> regulation of animal populations . lack 's observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of radar ornithology to study bird migration . lack was released from wartime duty in <month> <year> so as to take a position to as director ( succeeding <unk> . alexander ) of the edward grey institute of field ornithology at oxford university , a position that he held until his death in <year> . lack 's work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the living bird . he was one of the pioneers of <unk> studies in britain , especially those based on quantitative approaches , when some traditional ornithologists of the time were <unk> their studies on morphology and geographic distribution . lack 's major scientific research included work on population biology and density dependent regulation . his work suggested that natural selection favoured clutch <unk> that ensured the greatest number of surviving young . this interpretation was however debated by <unk> . wynne-edwards who suggested that clutch size was <unk> . this was one of the earliest debates on group selection . lack 's studies were based on <unk> birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings <month> not hold for other groups such as <unk> a mentor for numerous doctoral students , lack followed a <unk> method , letting students decide their own research topics . he encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the `` <unk> explanation , which was probably best . '' he would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to <unk> wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals , and had a <unk> of choosing memorable titles : he once claimed to have <unk> caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title `` territory and <unk> in a bishop '' . this <year> publication was subsequently titled `` territory and <unk> in a bishop bird , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( linn . ) '' in the journal ibis as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding . === darwin 's finches === lack 's most famous work is darwin 's finches , a landmark study whose title linked darwin 's name with the galapagos group of species and popularised the term `` darwin 's finches '' in <year> , though the term had been introduced by percy <unk> in <year>. there are two versions of this work , differing significantly in their conclusions . the first is a <unk> monograph , written after his visit to the galapagos , but not published until <year>. in it lack <unk> the differences in bill size as species recognition signals , that is , as isolating mechanisms . the second is the later book in which the differences in bill size are interpreted as adaptations to specific food niches , an interpretation that has since been <unk> confirmed . this change of mind , according to lack 's preface , came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work . the effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a <unk> of an isolating mechanism . in this way his work contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis , in which natural selection came to be seen as the prime <unk> in evolution , and not random or <unk> events . lack 's work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of peter and <unk> grant and their colleagues . lack 's work <unk> into studies of island biogeography which continue the same range of issues presented by the galapagos fauna on a more varied <unk> . according to ernst <month>r , `` the person who more than anyone else <unk> credit for <unk> an interest in the ecological significance of species was david lack ... it is now quite clear that the process of speciation is not completed by the acquisition of isolating mechanisms but requires also the acquisition of adaptations that permit <unk> with potential <unk> . '' === lack 's principle === in <year> lack took an interest in clutch size after reading <unk> 's manuscript sent to the ibis . lack was then an assistant to the editor of the ibis . lack postulated what is now known as lack 's principle , which states that `` the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to <unk> with the largest number of young for which the parents can , on average , provide enough food '' . === population regulation === lack took a keen interest in the mechanisms involved in regulating populations in nature . the natural regulation of animal numbers is one of lack 's most frequently cited works . here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained . it was critiqued by <unk> . haldane who found it lacking mathematical <unk> and biased to bird studies . the other major critic was <unk> . wynne-edwards with whom he clashed for nearly a decade . lack followed up on the criticisms in his later books including population studies of birds ( <year> ) . === published books === === published journal articles === == awards and honours == <year> : elected fellow of the royal society ( frs ) in <year> <year> : receives <unk> medal of the british ornithologists ' union <year>–1966 : president , international ornithological congress <year>–1965 : president , british ecological society <year> : awarded the darwin medal of the royal <unk> centenary of lack 's birth , <integer> <month> <year> , was marked by a <unk> lack centenary symposium ' , hosted by the edward grey institute . a programme of talks focused on and celebrated the scientific contributions of lack to ornithology , and the broader fields of ecology and evolution , and <unk> the development of these fields in the <days> century . == personal life == david lack married elizabeth lack ( née silva ) who was also an ornithologist . elizabeth silva was born in hertfordshire in <year> and took an early interest in music . she wished to joined the royal academy of music in london but the war led to her serving in the auxiliary territorial service as an <unk> <unk> in europe . after the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to richard <unk> who passed it on to david lack with a note `` here 's another for your reject file . '' lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary . noting her interest in birds , he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the <unk> woods . she also helped in the study of swifts . one day elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and david , worried that she might have fallen off a ladder , found her <unk> in observation . they became engaged in <year> and were married on <month> <integer> , <year>. the best man was george <unk> . they had four children : peter lack ( born <year> , a biologist ) , andrew lack ( born <year> , also a biologist and academic ) , paul lack ( born <year> , a freelance teacher ) , and catherine lack ( born <year> , a university <unk> ) . in oxford , the <unk> initially lived in a flat in park town , oxford , and later on <unk> hill , just south of oxford . lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field <unk> and tennis in which he also participated . lack died from <unk> 's lymphoma despite radiation treatments . === religious beliefs === lack 's parents belonged to the church of england and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to <unk> in <year> , possibly influenced by <unk> and mary <unk> , friends at dartington hall . he sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote , in <year> , evolutionary theory and christian belief , on the relationship between christian faith and evolutionary theory . lack believed that evolution could not account for morality , truth , beauty , free will , <unk> and individual responsibility . this book <unk> , in some ways , the <unk> <unk> conception of the relationship between religion and science later popularised by stephen jay gould . arthur <unk> remarked of him `` david lack was the only religious man i knew at that period who did not allow his religion to <unk> his view of natural selection .

world in dorset , england , a sanctuary for abused and neglected primates . he was widely acknowledged as an international expert in the rescue and rehabilitation of abused primates , and in the enforcement of international treaties aimed at protecting them from illegal trade and experimentation . cronin was awarded an honorary mbe by queen elizabeth ii in <year> for services to animal welfare . == early life == cronin was born in <unk> , new york , to <unk> parents . the son of a union official , he was educated at st denis school and lincoln high school . he had a number of jobs after leaving school before becoming a keeper at bronx zoo in the <year>s . while working there he realised he wanted to work with animals . in <year> he moved to kent in the uk to work in john aspinall 's zoo . == working with primates == cronin started his work with primates through working as a zoo keeper in various zoos . in <year> he came to britain where he acquired a job as a zoo keeper at john aspinall 's zoo at <unk> , where he <unk> his skills of primate rehabilitation and care . john aspinall had set up a breeding programme for <unk> which were an endangered species . cronin 's passion for working with primates made him quite successful in his career and encouraged him to have an ambition of one day building a safe haven for <unk> primates . during his years working at john aspinall 's zoo , he gave himself the necessary experience of dealing with apes on a daily basis in his career path of working with them as well as small monkeys and their complex life <unk> . == monkey world == it was during cronin 's years working as a zoo keeper at the <unk> zoo that he was <unk> about the plight of chimps being abused . these african great apes were being <unk> from the wild by illegal poachers and being transported abroad to europe , where the young chimpanzees were being purchased then used as photographic props by <unk> on beach <unk> in spain . these chimps would suffer <unk> abuse – having their <unk> <unk> out to prevent them <unk> <unk> , <unk> to remain <unk> , and physically beaten to remain <unk> and easy to handle before growing too big and being killed to be simply replaced by another . cronin was <unk> by the fate that these <unk> apes encountered and decided to <unk> his life in trying to solve the problem . in the middle <year>s spain had released legislation that <unk> the use of chimpanzees as photographer 's props , and this turn of action gave cronin some optimism on how he would reach his goal of helping the chimps . in <year> cronin approached a british couple called simon and peggy <unk> who had started rescuing the beach chimps in <year>. cronin worked together with the templers who had set up a half-way house where the <unk> chimps were being housed . the chimps would not be able to stay there for long , and it was cronin 's idea that <unk> light . cronin requested discussions on how he could possibly help and with the assistance of the spanish authorities ( the <unk> civil ) <unk> the chimps , there would certainly be more individuals arriving at the small half-way house . during <year> cronin returned to england and focused on how he could possibly build a sanctuary for the chimps . the templers agreed to <unk> the chimps at the sanctuary which cronin promised to be able to build . cronin recruited help from his best friend jeremy keeling , who was a fellow zoo keeper , and the pair set out to achieve their ambition of a primate sanctuary . cronin was <unk> about an abandoned <unk> farm located near wool , dorset . the old land covered <integer> acres and would be perfect for what would become a primate rescue centre . after securing a small business loan , cronin acquired permission to build the first enclosure which would be for the chimps . he knew that the animals needed to know how to live a natural way of life again , therefore cronin set up a map of the enclosure which would cover two acres , filled with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> climbing structures made from telephone <unk> . the whole two acres would be surrounded by an electric fence . after some finishing <unk> , such as human resources like a <unk> and a children 's <unk> , the sanctuary was finally complete and was named monkey world <unk> rescue centre . in <month> <year> , cronin was able to bring the first group of nine chimps from the templers ' half-way house to monkey world . once at the park , the chimpanzees were <unk> and housed in their new <unk> . also within the park was one <unk> female bornean <unk> named <unk> , who was brought by jeremy keeling , whose job it was to look after the animals at the centre . there was the arrival of some <unk> macaques , <unk> macaques and some <unk> <unk> , which made up the rest of the collection of primates housed in cronin 's rescue centre . more chimpanzees from spain arrived at the park . cronin opened monkey world on <integer> <month> <year> , providing the public with a rare opportunity to observe exotic primates . he made the sanctuary a rescue centre and not a zoo . the female chimpanzees were put on birth control to save space for more individuals <unk> rescuing . monkey world did not only rescue spanish beach chimps , but chimps from a variety of circumstances such as exotic pets , circus <unk> and medical research laboratory subjects . in <year> , cronin met alison ames , an authority on animal behaviour and cambridge graduate in biological anthropology . she and cronin were married in <year> , from then on running monkey world as a combined venture . cronin could hardly believe that his small refuge centre had grown into a <unk> rescue centre for primates from around the world . monkey world worked with the <unk> <unk> rescue centre in taiwan in stopping the illegal smuggling of apes from the wild , and monkey world was able to <unk> some of the primates from the <unk> <unk> rescue centre , including bornean <unk> and different species of <unk> . monkey world started working with foreign governments in the prevention of primate smuggling for pet trades , including the pet trade in britain which allowed citizens to keep exotic small monkeys without being able to care for them properly or meet their substantial needs . cronin and alison travelled to places around the world , investigating animal trades , especially the trade and exploitation of primates . cronin 's sanctuary had successfully recruited a number of primate care staff who see that the <unk> requirements of the primates are met . veterinary consultants were brought in to help treat the animals and adoption schemes were set up to allow the park to continue its rescue and rehabilitation work . the biggest rescue the centre undertook was that of the <integer> retired <unk> macaques from a medical research laboratory in the uk ; but the rescue mission in <year> , of the <integer> <unk> monkeys from a medical research laboratory in chile , took the record of the largest rescue of primates in the world . in <year> , cronin was awarded an mbe by queen elizabeth ii for services to animal welfare he was accompanied by robert <unk> . cronin has also received the jane <unk> award . the television series monkey business ( made by <unk> broadcasting and shown on itv <unk> in the uk and on animal planet worldwide ) has documented the cronin 's frequent rescue missions and <unk> investigations throughout europe and asia for the past <integer> years . beginning in <year> , monkey business was replaced with monkey life , which also documents the <unk> within monkey world . == death == following a brief battle with liver cancer , cronin died on <integer> <month> <year> at the <unk> medical center , manhattan , new york . he was survived by his daughter eleanor , from his first marriage , and his wife alison cronin . since his death , monkey world has been run by alison . === jim cronin memorial

physician , researcher , medical pioneer , founding member of the american society for neuroimaging ( asn ) , and originator of the technique of computed tomography . == early life == william `` bill '' oldendorf was born in <year> , the youngest of four children , in schenectady , new york . according to his sister dorothy , william developed an interest in science and imaging through his fascination with telescopes . while still in high school , he placed one on the front sidewalk of their <unk> and studied the stars late into the night . === academic education === oldendorf graduated from high school at the age of <integer> and afterwards attended union college in schenectady , new <unk> <unk> studies in just <integer> years . he received his medical degree from the albany medical college in albany , new york in <year> . === medical training === following medical <unk> at ellis hospital in schenectady , oldendorf completed a residency in psychiatry through the new york state department of mental health residency training program . then he enlisted for active duty in the united states navy as a medical officer and was posted at the u.s. naval hospital in newport , <unk> island . two years later oldendorf left the navy to complete a fellowship in neurology at the university of minnesota hospitals in minneapolis , minnesota ; for this reason , he was subsequently <unk> by the american board of psychiatry and neurology as a <unk> in both <unk> . == professional career == in <year> , oldendorf joined the faculty of the new medical school at the university of california , los angeles and the staff of the nearby <unk> west los angeles veterans administration medical center . he became an active member of the academic community , where his scientific , clinical , and teaching abilities were admired at the <unk> , in seminars , at clinical conferences , in the auditorium , and in his laboratory . he engaged students and colleagues in long discussions about <unk> theory , the scientific process , or results of medical research . by <year> , oldendorf was an attending neurologist at the wadsworth <unk> medical center where his ability to apply techniques from one field to another did not go <unk> . he was universally characterized as `` <unk> '' , `` friendly '' , `` <unk> '' , `` creative '' , `` intense '' , and `` humble '' . oldendorf 's interest neuroimaging was <unk> by a dislike for <unk> procedures ( like <unk> and direct <unk> <unk> ) that he performed as a clinical neurologist . oldendorf found that these traumatic , <unk> tests provided only limited and indirect information about the brain . at ucla , he started his seminal investigations into the two major lines of research that would define his career : x-ray shadow <unk> and cerebral <unk> . the first line was influential in the <unk> concept of neuroimaging ; the second yielded fundamental knowledge of brain metabolism and mechanisms of the blood–brain barrier . == contributions to medical science == === role in development of neuroimaging === in <year> , oldendorf conceived an idea for `` scanning a head through a transmitted <unk> of x-rays , and being able to reconstruct the <unk> patterns of a plane through the head '' by watching an engineer who was working on an automated apparatus to reject <unk> fruit by <unk> <unk> <unk> . not until <year> did he complete a working prototype of his idea , apply ( for $ <year> ) for a patent on his idea , and publish an article <unk> the work . <unk> , by using materials found in his home ( such as his son 's <unk> train , a <unk> <unk> , and an alarm clock motor ) , oldendorf demonstrated a method of producing <unk> images of soft tissue by <unk> and reconstruction . in his landmark paper , also published in <year> , he described the basic concept later used by allan <unk> cormack to develop the mathematics behind computerized tomography , though prof. cormack was unaware of oldendorf 's work . in <month> , <year> oldendorf finally received a u.s. patent for a `` <unk> energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects <unk> by dense material , '' . this work was recognized by godfrey hounsfield as the only other attempt at <unk> reconstruction , and , indeed , formed the basis of much of his nobel <unk> work . the prototype developed by dr. oldendorf , however , did not lead to the development of the first industrial cat scanning device . when suggested to a leading x-ray manufacturer of the time , the president of the company <unk> , even if it could be made to work as you suggest , we can not imagine a significant market for such an expensive apparatus which would do nothing but make a <unk> <unk> of a head . faced with this reaction , oldendorf `` turned his attention to other scientific work and heard nothing further about the idea until <year> . '' however , his idea was a fundamental discovery which also led to mri , <unk> emission tomography ( pet ) , single <unk> emission computed tomography ( spect ) , and other imaging techniques . once these techniques became widely accepted , dr. oldendorf , along with william <unk> <unk> , md ( <year>–2003 ) were instrumental in promoting the use of computed tomography among neurologists to help decrease the use of <unk> and <unk> tests . === blood–brain barrier === oldendorf made many other discoveries that have significantly affected neuroscience and the practice of medicine . he developed an original method to analyze blood flow in the brain and the <unk> of <unk> permeability . the idea of the blood–brain barrier was already <unk> in medical science by this time , but had never been <unk> . oldendorf 's work in measuring blood flow with radioactive isotopes was fundamental to the subsequent development of techniques now used in many nuclear medicine laboratories . his methods of assessing blood–brain barrier permeability increased knowledge of the mechanisms whereby drugs and metabolic <unk> enter into the brain . especially important was his characterization of more than a dozen independent carrier systems , along with their <unk> <unk> . today , most of what is known of the selective permeability of the blood–brain barrier was either established by oldendorf in his laboratory , or by others using his ingenious techniques . these results have been essential in developing pet and spect imaging ; in studying glucose transport and brain metabolism ; and in characterizing <unk> important diseases such as cerebral ischemia , starvation , and epilepsy . oldendorf 's experiments were also was the first to prove that cerebrospinal fluid functions as a `` sink '' in relationship to brain metabolism , a concept that is being investigated in relation to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> such as alzheimer 's disease . === professional publications and societies === in his lifetime , oldendorf wrote three textbooks and over <integer> scientific articles , including the quest for an image of the brain : computerized tomography in the perspective of past and future imaging methods ( raven press , new york , <year> ) and <unk> of magnetic resonance imaging ( kluwer academic press , boston , <year> ) . the book <unk> of magnetic resonance imaging is notable for being co-authored with his son and namesake , william oldendorf , jr . oldendorf was one of the <integer> <unk> of the neurology computed tomography symposium , organized by william <unk> from <month> <integer> to <month> <integer> , <year> , in buffalo , new york . he participated in the ad hoc committee that unanimously voted to form the society for computerized tomography so as to continue its educational activities . realizing that other imaging <unk> <month> eventually be prominent , the following year oldendorf pushed to have the name of the society changed to society for computerized tomography and neuroimaging , and served as its president from <year> to <year>. this society was to rename itself the american society for neuroimaging ( asn ) in <year> , also with the <unk> of oldendorf . oldendorf was on several editorial boards and was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences . in <year> , he became the first neurologist ever to be elected to the national academy of sciences . == awards and prizes == in <year> , he shared the <unk> des <unk> gold medal ( given by the german society of neuroradiology and the medical physics society of <unk> ) with godfrey hounsfield . oldendorf was also awarded the albert and mary lasker award for clinical research in <year> along with prof. hounsfield for `` concepts and experiments which directly anticipated and demonstrated the feasibility of computerized tomography , which has <unk> the field of neurological diagnosis '' . he received a special leadership award from the american academy of neurology in <year> for `` contributions to clinical neurology , including computerized <unk> scanning , studies on the blood–brain barrier , and research on cerebral metabolism . '' in <year> he received the president 's award for distinguished federal civilian service and the medical sciences award from the ucla alumni association . oldendorf was also fellow of the institute

i wanted to live a life free from fear and <unk> , a calm and <unk> life , without turmoil and conflict . ... when i followed the advice of old <unk> and <unk> , and tried to <unk> my greed , my pride and aggression , <unk> , <unk> and conflict diminished . `` for the next two years , khan worked in <unk> village near <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> , an experience that provided him with <unk> knowledge of the problems and issues of rural communities . in <year> , he took up a teaching position at the <unk> <unk> , delhi , where he worked for three years . in <year> , khan migrated to pakistan to teach at <unk> college , karachi . in the same year , he was invited by the government of pakistan to take charge as principal of comilla victoria college in east pakistan , a position he held until <year>. during this time ( <year>–58 ) he also served as president of the east pakistan <unk> teachers ' association . == rural development initiatives == during his tenure as principal of comilla victoria college , khan developed a special interest in grassroots actions . between <year> and <year> , he took a break to work as director of the village agricultural and industrial development ( v-aid ) programme . however , he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers . in <year> , he went to michigan state university to acquire education and training in rural development . returning in <year> , he established the pakistan academy for rural development ( <unk> , eventually renamed as bangladesh academy for rural development ) at comilla on <integer> <month> <year> and was appointed as its founding director . khan became vice-chairman of the board of governors of <unk> in <year> , and in the same year , was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by michigan state university . in <year> , he established collaborative links with arthur lewis . == advisory roles == following his move to pakistan , khan was asked to implement the comilla model in rural settlements of <unk> frontier province ( now <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> , and <unk> . he declined the offer on the grounds that the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being . however , he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development , such as participatory irrigation management . he worked as a research fellow at the university of agriculture , <unk> from <year> to <year> , and as director of rural economics research project at karachi university from <year> to <year>. khan went to michigan state university as a visiting professor in <year> and remained there until <year>. during this time , he carried on advising the rural development academy at <unk> in northern bangladesh , and the pakistan academy for rural development , <unk> , on the <unk> integrated rural development programme . in <year> , he was appointed as a world bank consultant to survey rural development situations in java , indonesia . he also briefly worked as a visiting professor at lund university , harvard university , and the university of <unk> <year> , khan moved to karachi and started working on the improvement of <unk> conditions in karachi suburbs . he laid the foundations of the orangi pilot project for the largest <unk> community of orangi in the city . he remained associated with this project until his death in <year>. meanwhile , he maintained his support for rural communities around karachi , and also helped to develop the <unk> khan rural support programme . opp became a model for participatory bottom-up development initiatives . == major development programmes == === comilla cooperative pilot project === the comilla model ( <year> ) was khan 's initiative in response to the failure of a village agricultural and industrial development ( v-aid ) programme that was launched in <year> in east and west pakistan with technical assistance from the us government . v-aid remained a <unk> attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development . khan launched the project in <year> on his return from michigan , and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of <unk> participation . initially , the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country . advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from harvard and michigan state universities , the ford foundation , and <unk> model simultaneously addressed the problems that were caused by the <unk> of both local infrastructure and institutions through a range of integrated programmes . the initiatives included the establishment of : a training and development centre ; a <unk> <unk> works programme ; a decentralized , small scale irrigation programme ; and , a <unk> cooperative system with primary cooperatives operating in the villages , and <unk> operating at <unk> <unk> khan 's departure from comilla , the cooperative 's model failed in independent bangladesh because only a few occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success . by <year> , only <integer> of the <integer> cooperatives were functioning . the model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls , <unk> , and <unk> of funds . this prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in <unk> , such as muhammad <unk> of <unk> bank and <unk> hasan <unk> of <unk> , to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures . the new strategy targeted the <unk> villagers , while excluding the <unk> poor ' . however , khan 's leadership skills during the course of his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders , as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country . === orangi pilot project === the orangi poverty alleviation project ( known as the orangi pilot project , or opp ) was initiated by khan as an ngo in <year>. orangi is located on the northwest <unk> of karachi . at that time , it was the largest of the city 's approximately <integer> low-income <unk> settlements ( known as <unk> <unk> ) . the <unk> was first developed in <year> as a government <unk> of <integer> square kilometres ( <unk> acres ) . the influx of migrants after the creation of bangladesh <unk> the settlement to about one million people <unk> over an area of more than <integer> square kilometres ( <unk> acres ) . the working class <unk> population was predominantly composed of day labourers , skilled workers , <unk> , small <unk> , <unk> and low-income white collar workers . the project proved an impetus to the socio-economic development of the population of the area . as the project director , khan proved to be a dynamic and innovative leader . the project initially focused on creating a system of underground <unk> , using local materials and labour , and succeeded in laying hundreds of kilometres of <unk> <unk> along with auxiliary facilities . within a decade of the initiative , local residents had established schools , health clinics , women 's work centres , cooperative stores and a credit organisation to finance enterprise projects . by <year> , opp had managed to provide <unk> <unk> to more than <unk> houses . the project subsequently diversified into a number of programmes , including a people 's financed and managed <unk> sanitation programme ; a housing programme ; a basic health and family planning programme ; a programme of supervised credit for small family enterprise units ; an education programme ; and a rural development programme in the nearby <unk> the opp with comilla project , akhter hameed khan once commented : the orangi pilot project was very different from the comilla academy . opp was a private body , dependent for its small fixed budget on another ngo . the vast resources and support of the government , harvard advisors , <unk> , and ford foundation was missing . opp possessed no authority , no sanctions . it <month> observe and investigate but it could only advise , not enforce . the successful opp model became an inspiration for other municipalities around the country . in <year> , khan helped to create <unk> pilot project ( <unk> ) to collaborate with <unk> municipal committee . learning from past experiences , the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only . the municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider <unk> <unk> success of opp did come at a cost for dr khan as his liberal views and <unk> initiatives were questioned and criticised by certain interest groups . at two occasions , he was accused of <unk> . however , all allegations against him were <unk> by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars . == death == in <year> , khan was visiting his family in the united states when he suffered from kidney failure . he died of myocardial <unk> on <integer> <month> in indianapolis at the age of <decimal> his body was flown to karachi on <integer> <month> , where he was buried on the grounds of the opp office <unk> . == legacy == khan 's ideology and leadership skills were a source of inspiration for his students and colleagues , and continue to serve as guiding principles even after his death . edgar <unk> , who became an admirer of khan 's ideology while working at usaid 's asia bureau , co-authored a book with robert shaw as a result of observations and discussions with khan at comilla academy . a later study of various rural development experiences from south asia , edited by <unk> and <unk> ( <year> ) was jointly dedicated to khan and <unk> after khan 's death , on <integer> <month> <year> , the government of pakistan renamed the national centre for rural development the akhter hameed khan national centre for rural development and municipal <unk> in <year> , the council of social sciences , pakistan , in collaboration with the national rural support programme and other institutions , announced the akhter hameed khan memorial award . the annual cash award is given on khan 's birthday to a pakistani author for a book on issues related to rural and urban development , peace , poverty alleviation , or gender discrimination . at the occasion of the award ceremony in <year> , a documentary film about the life and times of akhter hameed khan was premiered . the film includes archival <unk> and interviews with family members , colleagues , and contributors and <unk> of the comilla and opp <unk> akhter hameed khan resource centre ( ahk resource center ) was established in islamabad , under the auspices of the institute of rural management , as a repository of published and digital resources on rural development . the akhter hameed khan resource center was initially formed in <year> as a repository of works and writings by khan and his <unk> <unk> <unk> khan ;

educated at westminster school and cambridge university ( caius and king 's ) . in <year> he received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for developing an accounting model that could be used to track economic activities on a national and , later , an international scale . == early life == richard stone was born in london , uk on <integer> <month> <year>. he received an english upper middle class education when he was a child as he attended <unk> place and westminster school . however , he had not been taught mathematics and science until secondary school . when he was <integer> years old , he followed his father to india as his father was appointed as a judge in madras . from india , he visited many asian countries : malaya , singapore , and indonesia . after travelling for one year , he went back to london and studied at gonville and caius college , cambridge in <year> , where he studied law for two years . the young stone then changed to reading economics . he was interested in economics as he thought that `` if there were more economists , the world would be a better place '' . during the great <unk> of the <year>s , the of unemployment was very high and it motivated him to know what caused it and how to overcome it . he faced a challenge from his parents as they were disappointed to his choice . however , stone was very enthusiastic to be an economist and then enjoyed his time studying economics . at his new major , he got supervision from richard <unk> and gerald <unk> . however , stone 's quantitative mind had been greatly influenced by colin clark , stone 's teacher in statistics at cambridge . clark then introduced stone to his project in measuring the national income . this project then brought the greatest name for stone as he received nobel prize because of this topic . after their meeting at cambridge , stone and clark then became best friends . == career == after graduating from cambridge in <year> and until world war ii he worked at lloyd 's of london . during the war , stone worked with james meade as a statistician and economist for the british government . at the government 's request they analyzed the uk 's economy related to the current total resources of the nation for the war time . it was at this time that they developed the early versions of the system of national accounts . their work resulted in the u.k. 's first national accounts in <year> . the collaboration between stone and meade was over after <year> as their office was split into two different ones . they then worked separately , meade being responsible for the economic section and stone , for the national income . in his new office , the central statistical office , stone became john <month>nard keynes ' assistant . stone left working for the government when the war ended in <year> . after the war , stone took up an academic career when he worked at cambridge as the director of the new department of applied economics ( <year>–1955 ) . as the director , stone made the department focus on research programmes about economic theory and statistical methodology . this strategy attracted many top economists in that era to join the department . some remarkable works at the department were , for example , <unk> and watson on testing serial correlation in econometrics , and alan <unk> and derek rowe on demand analysis . this condition made <unk> become one of the leading quantitative economic research centres in the world in his era . stone himself had many projects in <unk> : national accounting where he had employed <unk> chapman as a research associate , the analysis of consumer demand , and the system of <unk> account . in <year> , stone gave up his directorship at the department as he was appointed as the <unk> . <unk> chair of finance and accounting at cambridge ( emeritus from <year> ) . together with <unk> . brown he began the cambridge growth project , which developed the cambridge multisectoral dynamic model of the british economy ( <unk> ) . in building the cambridge growth project , they used social accounting matrices ( sam ) , which also formed <unk> equilibrium model which then developed at the world bank . he was succeeded as leader of the cambridge growth project by terry <unk> . in <year> , stone was appointed as the chairman of the faculty board of economics and politics for the next two years . a company founded by members of the department and limited by guarantee , cambridge econometrics , was founded in <year> with stone as its first honorary president . the company continues to develop <unk> and to use the model to make economic forecasts . before retiring from cambridge in <year> , stone served as the president of the royal economic society for <year>–1980 . == achievements == stone in <year> received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for developing an accounting model that could be used to track economic activities on a national and , later , an international scale . while he was not the first economist to work in this field , he was the first to do so with double entry accounting . double entry accounting basically states that every income item on one side of the balance sheet must be met by an expenditure item on the opposite side of the accounting sheet therefore creating a system of balance . this double entry system is the basis of nearly all modern accounting today . this allowed for a reliable way of tracking trade and wealth transfer on a global scale . he is sometimes known as the <unk> of national income accounting ' , and is the author of studies of consumer demand statistics and demand modeling , economic growth , and <unk> his acceptance speech stone mentioned françois <unk> as well as the <unk> économique . stone stated that it was one of the first works in economics to examine various sectors on such a global level and how they are all interconnected . == personal life == stone married three times . in <year> , he married winifred mary jenkins who was also from cambridge . both of them had a passion for economics and started a monthly paper called trends , which was a

critical pedagogy . his influential work pedagogy of the oppressed is generally considered one of the <unk> texts of the critical pedagogy movement , and was the third most cited book in the social sciences as of <year> according to google scholar . == biography == freire was born on <integer> <month> <year> to a <unk> family in recife , the capital of the northeastern brazilian state of <unk> . he became familiar with poverty and hunger from an early age as a result of the great depression . in <year> his family moved to the more affordable city of <unk> dos <unk> , <integer> km west of recife . his father died on <integer> <month> <year>.during his childhood and <unk> , freire ended up four <unk> behind , and his social life <unk> around playing <unk> football with other poor children , from whom he claims to have learned a great deal . these experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint . freire stated that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn . these experiences influenced his decision to <unk> his life to improving the lives of the poor : `` i did n't understand anything because of my hunger . i was n't <unk> . it was n't lack of interest . my social condition did n't allow me to have an education . experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge '' . eventually , his family 's <unk> turned around and their prospects <unk> enrolled in law school at the university of recife in <year>. he also studied philosophy , more specifically phenomenology , and the psychology of language . although admitted to the legal bar , he never practiced law and instead worked as a secondary school portuguese teacher . in <year> , he married <unk> maia costa de <unk> , a fellow teacher . the two worked together and had five <unk> <year> , freire was appointed director of the <unk> department of education and culture . working primarily among the <unk> poor , freire began to develop an educational <unk> that would have an influence on the liberation theology movement of the <year>s . in <year>s brazil , literacy was a requirement for voting in presidential elections . in <year> , he was appointed director of the department of cultural extension at the university of recife . in <year> , he had the first opportunity for large-scale application of his theories , when , in an experiment , <integer> <unk> <unk> were taught to read and write in just <integer> days . in response to this experiment , the brazilian government approved the creation of thousands of cultural circles across the <unk> <year> brazilian coup d'état put an end to freire 's literacy effort , as the ruling military junta did not endorse it . freire was subsequently imprisoned as a <unk> for <integer> days . after a brief exile in bolivia , freire worked in chile for five years for the christian democratic agrarian reform movement and the united nations food and agriculture organization . in <year> , freire published his first book , education as the practice of freedom . he followed it up with his most famous work , pedagogy of the oppressed , which was first published in <year> . after a positive international reception of his work , freire was offered a visiting professorship at harvard university in <year>. the next year , pedagogy of the oppressed was published in spanish and english , vastly expanding its reach . because of political feuds between freire , a christian socialist , and brazil 's successive right-wing authoritarian military governments , the book went unpublished in brazil until <year> , when , starting with the presidency of ernesto <unk> , the military junta started a process of slow and controlled political <unk> a year in cambridge , massachusetts , freire moved to geneva to work as a special education advisor to the world council of churches . during this time freire acted as an advisor on education reform in several former portuguese colonies in africa , particularly <unk> and <unk> . in <year> , he first visited brazil after more than a decade of exile , eventually moving back in <year>. freire joined the workers ' party ( <unk> ) in são paulo and acted as a supervisor for its adult literacy project from <year> to <year>. when the workers ' party won the <year> são paulo <month>oral elections in <year> , freire was appointed municipal secretary of education . freire died of heart failure on <integer> <month> <year> , in são paulo . == pedagogy == there is no such thing as a neutral education process . education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate the integration of generations into the logic of the present system and bring about <unk> to it , or it becomes the `` practice of freedom '' , the means by which men and women deal critically with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world . paulo freire contributed a philosophy of education which blended classical approaches <unk> from plato and modern marxist , <unk> , and <unk> thinkers . his pedagogy of the oppressed ( <year> ) can be read as an extension of , or reply to , <unk> <unk> 's the <unk> of the earth ( <year> ) , which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern , rather than traditional , and <unk> – not simply an extension of the <unk> culture . in pedagogy of the oppressed , freire , <unk> the <unk> distinction , <unk> the distinction to education , <unk> that education should allow the oppressed to <unk> their sense of humanity , in turn overcoming their condition . nevertheless , he <unk> that for this to occur , the oppressed individual must play a role in their liberation . no pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as <unk> and by presenting for their <unk> models from among the oppressors . the oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their <unk> . likewise , oppressors must be willing to <unk> their way of life and to examine their own role in oppression if true liberation is to occur : `` those who <unk> commit themselves to the people must <unk> themselves constantly '' <unk> believed education could not be divorced from politics ; the act of teaching and learning are considered political acts in and of themselves . freire defined this connection as a main tenet of critical pedagogy . teachers and students must be made aware of the politics that surround education . the way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda . teachers , themselves , have political notions they bring into the classroom . freire believed that education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and <unk> themselves , because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of <unk> knowing that they know and knowing that they do n't . === criticism of the `` banking model '' of education === in terms of pedagogy , freire is best known for his attack on what he called the `` banking '' concept of education , in which students are viewed as <unk> accounts to be filled by teachers . he notes that `` it <unk> students into receiving objects [ and ] attempts to control thinking and action , lead [ ing ] men and women to <unk> to the world , <unk> [ ing ] their creative power .

'' in <year> , he testified before the international court of justice in support of apartheid in south africa . == on <unk> in u.s. immigration policy == in another article , from <year> , he criticized the immigration and nationality act of <year> , which replaced an immigration system largely excluding asians and <unk> against southern and eastern <unk> with a <unk> program based on skills and family connections to u.s. citizens and permanent residents , which enabled an increase in immigration from asia . van den haag instead advocated greater rather than less immigration <unk> . he also <unk> defended the practice of <unk> immigration policies in favor of european ethnicity , arguing that `` the wish to preserve ... the identity of one 's nation requires no justification . '' he likened such a practice to a <unk> expression of sentiment , similar to preferring to associate with one 's own family rather than <unk> . `` the wish not to see one 's country overrun by groups one regards as alien need not be based on feelings of <unk> or <unk> . ' '' == on the death penalty == van den haag ’ s particular field of interest , the field he contributed the most to in terms of publications , was the death penalty . van den haag was a respected debater , and when he was not contributing to the national review or other publications , he was active in debating the issue of the death penalty . his main argument in its defense stemmed from key themes such as deterrence , and punishment for severe <unk> den haag ’ s ideology is clearly conservative ; in his book punishing criminals , he defines the primary role of government as “ securing rights and duties by <unk> them through laws and <unk> the <unk> ” van den haag believed the <unk> duty of government is to “ provide legal order in which citizens can be secure in their lives , their liberties , and their pursuit of <unk> ” the law exists to provide legal order . van den haag disputed claims that capital punishment is just a form of legal retribution by claiming that if laws are knowingly broken , legal order can only be maintained by enforcement . justice , van den haag claimed , is <unk> , while retribution carries the weight of passion behind it ; justice being delivered to someone who <unk> social order knowingly is equal , thus the term legal retribution is <unk> den haag also argued that people commit crimes because they believe , one way or another , they will benefit from committing the crime . thus it is society ’ s duty to make all crimes as <unk> as possible . van den haag uses economic examples to further prove his point . in economics , there is a concept named opportunity cost . opportunity cost forces an individual to <unk> the benefits versus the sacrifices of making a decision . van den haag believes people look at committing the crime the same way they would view an opportunity ; they would <unk> the profits versus the punishment . <unk> to commit a crime will be significantly decreased if the punishment for committing the crime is more severe . the death penalty offers the greatest weighted punishment for committing an <unk> . van den haag also related marxist theory behind his justification of the death penalty . <unk> , van den haag argued , believe that “ legal justice never can do less , though it can do <unk> ” legal justice should <unk> punishment equally among <unk> and more frequently in order to deter crime . van den haag also related to the marxist belief in class warfare . van den haag states , “ obviously , the poor and <unk> are more <unk> to take what is not <unk> , or to <unk> , than the powerful and wealthy , who need not take what they already <unk> ” the threat of severe punishment <unk> <unk> , which van den haag argued is to be the greatest use of the death penalty , deterrence . van den haag also believed that law <unk> have more of an inclination to do it again . breaking the law leads to a form of moral decay when eventually <unk> no longer can distinguish right from wrong , thus repeat offending is a common occurrence . his response to this was , “ the only permanent , and <unk> <unk> is <unk> ” van den haag believed that any temporary or permanent <unk> only reduces the crime rate if there are no more <unk> increases in crime by other people . however , if no strong <unk> such as the death penalty existed , an increase in crime and criminals will still be a factor . van den haag believed <unk> to be the most <unk> crime a human being can commit . van den haag , in his book the death penalty : a debate , argues that “ the state must teach that killing anyone deliberately , for whatever reason , is <unk> and <unk> ” van den haag believed that capital punishment has a direct correlation with a decrease in murders . rehabilitation as a response to <unk> criminals is not an option because , as van den haag states , “ no effective method to achieve it [ rehabilitation ] has been <unk> ” if a proper method of rehabilitation can be found , it would not reduce the crime rate , because rehabilitation only works after the crime has been committed . deterrence is the only thing that can have any effect on the actual crime rate . overall , van den haag directed his argument toward the fact that the death penalty ought only to exist to protect innocent lives . to sum up his entire argument against his opposition in one quote , van den haag <unk> , “ i ’ d rather <unk> a man convicted of having murdered others than put the lives of <unk> at risk . i find it hard to understand the opposite <unk> ” van den haag recognized that innocent people would sometimes be executed . == literary works == throughout his life , ernest van den haag wrote many books and articles about society , and more specifically about capital punishment . his works include : the death penalty : a debate , <year> ( co-authored with john p. conrad ) the jewish <unk> , <year> political violence and civil <unk> , <year> punishing criminals : concerning a very old and painful question , <year> == references == == external links == the war in <unk> ;

tailliez who in <year> lent him some <unk> underwater goggles , predecessors of modern swimming goggles . cousteau also belonged to the information service of the french navy , and was sent on missions to shanghai and japan ( <unk> ) and in the ussr ( <year> ) .on <integer> <month> <year> , he married simone <unk> , his business partner , with whom he had two sons , jean-michel ( born

diving === the years of world war ii were decisive for the history of diving . after the <unk> of <year> , the family of simone and jacques-yves cousteau took refuge in <unk> , where he became a friend of the ichac family who also lived there . jacques-yves cousteau and marcel ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places — for cousteau the underwater world and for ichac the high mountains . the two <unk> took the first <unk> prize of the congress of documentary film in <year> , for the first french underwater film : par <unk> <unk> de fond ( <integer> meters deep ) , made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the <unk> islands in var , with philippe tailliez and frédéric dumas , using a <unk> camera case developed by mechanical engineer léon <unk> , an engineer of arts and measures at the naval college . in <year> , they made the film épaves ( <unk> ) , in which they used two of the very first aqua-lung prototypes . these prototypes were made in <unk> by the air <unk> company , following instructions from cousteau and émile <unk> . when making épaves , cousteau could not find the necessary <unk> <unk> of movie film , but had to buy hundreds of small still camera film <unk> the same <unk> , intended for a make of child 's camera , and <unk> them together to make long <unk> kept bonds with the english speakers ( he spent part of his childhood in the united states and usually spoke english ) and with french soldiers in north africa ( under admiral <unk> ) , jacques-yves cousteau ( whose villa ``

services in france , and received several military decorations for his <unk> . at that time , he kept his distance from his brother pierre-antoine cousteau , a `` pen <unk> '' who wrote the collaborationist newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> ( i am everywhere ) and who received the death sentence in <year>. however , this was later <unk> to a life sentence , and pierre-antoine was released in <year> . during the <year>s , cousteau is credited with improving the aqua-lung design which gave birth to the <unk> scuba technology used today . according to his first book , the silent world : a story of undersea discovery and adventure ( <year> ) , cousteau started diving with <unk> goggles in <year> , and in <year> used the <unk> underwater breathing apparatus invented in <year> by commander <unk> le <unk> . cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the le <unk> apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a demand <unk> , invented in <year> by émile <unk> . in <year> cousteau tried out the first prototype aqua-lung which finally made extended underwater exploration possible . === late <year>s : gers and élie monnier === in <year> , cousteau and tailliez showed the film épaves ( `` <unk> '' ) to admiral <unk> , who gave them the responsibility of setting up the <unk> de recherches <unk> ( <unk> ) ( underwater research group ) of the french navy in <unk> . a little later it became the gers ( groupe <unk> et de recherches <unk> , = underwater studies and research group ) , then the <unk> ( `` <unk> des interventions <unk> la <unk> '' , = `` undersea interventions command '' ) , and finally more recently the <unk> . in <year> , chief <unk> officer maurice <unk> became the first diver to die using an <unk> , while attempting a new depth record with the gers near <unk> <year> , between missions of mine clearance , underwater exploration and technological and physiological tests , cousteau undertook a first campaign in the mediterranean on board the <unk> élie monnier , with philippe tailliez , frédéric dumas , jean <unk> and the <unk> writer marcel ichac . the small team also undertook the exploration of the roman wreck of <unk> ( tunisia ) . it was the first underwater archaeology operation using autonomous diving , opening the way for scientific underwater archaeology . cousteau and marcel ichac brought back from there the <unk> diving film ( presented and preceded with the cannes film festival <year> ) . cousteau and the élie monnier then took part in the rescue of professor jacques <unk> 's <unk> , the <unk> , during the <year> expedition to <unk> . thanks to this rescue , the french navy was able to <unk> the sphere of the <unk> to construct the <unk> . the adventures of this period are told in the two books the silent world ( <year> , by cousteau and dumas ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <year> , by philippe tailliez ) . === <unk> === in <year> , cousteau left the french navy . in <year> , he founded the french oceanographic campaigns ( <unk> ) , and leased a ship called calypso from thomas <unk> guinness for a symbolic one <unk> a year . cousteau <unk> the calypso as a mobile laboratory for field research and as his principal vessel for diving and filming . he also carried out underwater archaeological excavations in the mediterranean , in particular at <unk> ( <year> ) . with the publication of his first book in <year> , the silent world , cousteau <unk> predicted the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises . he reported that his research vessel , the élie <unk> , was heading to the straits of gibraltar and noticed a group of porpoises following them . cousteau changed course a few degrees off the optimal course to the center of the <unk> , and the porpoises followed for a few minutes , then <unk> toward <unk> again . it was evident that they knew where the optimal course lay , even if the humans did not . cousteau concluded that the <unk> had something like <unk> , which was a relatively new feature on <unk> . in <year> , cousteau conducted a survey of <unk> <unk> waters on behalf of british petroleum . among those accompanying him was louis <unk> who made a <unk> film of the expedition for the company . cousteau won the palme d'or at the cannes film festival in <year> for the silent world co-produced with <unk> . in <year> , cousteau took over as leader of the oceanographic museum of monaco . afterward , with the assistance of jean <unk> , he made a `` diving saucer '' <unk> , an experimental underwater vehicle which could reach a depth of <integer> meters . the successful experiment was quickly repeated in <year> with two vehicles which reached <integer> meters . in <year> , he was elected as director of the <unk> museum of monaco . he directed <unk> , about the experiments of diving in <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , houses under the sea ) , and was admitted to the united states national

in the mediterranean sea by the commissariat à <unk> <unk> ( cea ) . the cea argued that the <unk> were experimental in nature , and that french oceanographers such as <unk> romanovsky had recommended it . romanovsky and other french scientists , including louis <unk> and jacques cousteau , <unk> the claim , saying that romanovsky had in mind a much smaller amount . the cea claimed that there was little circulation ( and hence little need for concern ) at the <unk> site between nice and <unk> , but french public opinion sided with the oceanographers rather than with the cea atomic energy scientists . the cea chief , francis perrin , decided to postpone the <unk> . cousteau organized a publicity campaign which in less than two weeks gained wide popular support . the train carrying the waste was stopped by women and children sitting on the railway tracks , and it was sent back to its origin . in the <year>s , cousteau was involved with a set of three projects to build underwater `` villages '' ; the projects were named precontinent i , precontinent ii and precontinent iii . each ensuing project was aimed at increasing the depth at which people continuously lived under water , and were an attempt at creating an environment in which men could live and work on the sea floor . the projects are best known as conshelf i ( <year> ) , conshelf ii ( <year> ) , and conshelf iii ( <year> ) . the names `` precontinent '' , and `` continental <unk> station '' ( conshelf ) were used <unk> by cousteau . a meeting with american television companies ( abc , <unk> , nbc ) created the series the undersea world of jacques cousteau , with the character of the commander in the red bonnet inherited from standard diving <unk> intended to give the films a `` <unk> adventure '' style . this documentary television series ran for ten years from <year> to <year>. a second documentary series , the cousteau odyssey , ran from <year> to <year> on public television stations . in <year> , he wrote the book the shark : splendid savage of the sea with his son philippe . in this book , cousteau described the <unk> <unk> shark as `` the most dangerous of all <unk> '' . in <month> <year> , two years after the <unk> 's last <unk> , the cousteau society was filming voyage au <unk> du monde on <unk> island , antarctica , when michel laval , calypso 's second in command , was struck and killed by a <unk> of the <unk> that was <unk> between calypso and the <unk> <year> , along with his two sons and frederick <unk> , he created the cousteau society for the protection of ocean life , frederick <unk> being its first president . in <year> , john <unk> released the tribute song `` calypso '' on his album <unk> , and on the <unk> of his hit song `` i 'm sorry '' . `` calypso '' became a hit on its own and was later considered the new <unk> , reaching no . <integer> on the charts . in <year> , cousteau located the wreck of <unk> <unk> . he also found the wreck of the french <days>-century <unk> la <unk> in coastal waters of crete . in <year> , together with peter scott , he received the un international environment prize . on <integer> <month> <year> , while the calypso was on an expedition to portugal , his second son philippe , his preferred and designated successor and with whom he had co-produced all his films since <year> , died in a <unk> catalina flying boat crash in the <unk> river near lisbon . cousteau was deeply affected . he called his then eldest son , the architect jean-michel , to his side . this collaboration lasted <integer> years . === <unk>

from that point , the relations between jacques-yves and his elder son worsened . in <month> <year> , cousteau gave an interview to the unesco courier , in which he stated that he was in favour of human population control and population decrease . widely quoted on the internet are these two <unk> from the interview : `` what should we do to eliminate suffering and disease ? it 's a wonderful idea but perhaps not altogether a beneficial one in the long run . if we try to implement it we <month> <unk> the future of our species ... it 's terrible to have to say this . world population must

, cousteau believed that the teachings of the different major <unk> provide valuable ideals and thoughts to protect the environment . in a chapter entitled `` the holy <unk> and the environment '' in the posthumous work the human , the <unk> , and the octopus , he is quoted as stating that `` the <unk> of nature provides evidence that god exists '' . === opinion on recreational fishing === cousteau said because fish are <unk> , does not mean they do not feel pain , and that recreational <unk> only say so to reassure their <unk> . == death and legacy == jacques-yves cousteau died of a

<integer> books , and an environmental protection foundation with <other>00,000 <unk> liked to call himself an `` oceanographic technician '' . he was , in reality , a sophisticated <unk> , teacher , and lover of nature . his work permitted many people to explore the resources of the oceans . his work also created a new kind of scientific communication , criticized at the time by some academics . the so-called `` <unk> '' , a simple way of sharing scientific concepts , was soon employed in other disciplines and became one of the most important characteristics of modern television broadcasting . <unk> , cousteau 's most lasting legacy <month> be a negative one . his oceanographic museum in monaco , and perhaps even he himself , has been identified as introducing the <unk> `` <unk> <unk> , '' which is destroying much of the mediterranean 's ecosystem . the cousteau society and its french counterpart , <unk> cousteau , both of which jacques-yves cousteau founded , are still active today . the society is currently attempting to turn the original calypso into a museum and it is raising funds to build a successor vessel , the calypso ii . in his last years , after marrying again ,

and russian economist , politician , and author , and was the acting prime minister of russia from <integer> <month> <year> to <integer> <month> <year> . he was the architect of the controversial shock therapy reforms administered in russia after the dissolution of the soviet union , which brought him both praise and harsh criticism . he participated in the preparation of the <unk> agreements . many russians held him responsible for the economic <unk> that plagued the country in the <year>s that resulted in mass poverty and hyperinflation among other things , although liberals praised him as a man who did what had to be done to save the country from complete collapse . <unk> <unk> , director of columbia university 's earth institute , who advised the russian government in the early <year>s , called gaidar `` the intellectual leader of many of russia 's political and economic reforms '' and `` one of the few pivotal actors '' of the <unk> died of <unk> <unk> , provoked by myocardial ischemia on <integer> <month> <year> . == personal life == gaidar was born in <year> in moscow , rsfsr , soviet union , the son of <unk> <unk> and <unk> military correspondent <unk> gaidar , who fought in the bay of pigs invasion and was a friend of raúl castro . his paternal grandfather was soviet writer <unk> gaidar and his maternal grandfather was writer pavel <unk> . despite the <unk> surname , gaidar was russian ; his grandfather , originally called `` <unk> '' , adopted the name `` gaidar '' from the <unk> language as a <unk> . gaidar married the daughter of writer <unk> <unk> during his time at the university . his daughter , maria gaidar , was one of the leaders of the russian democratic opposition . from <month> <year> till <month> <year> she was deputy chair of the government of <unk> oblast . in <year> and <year> she was <unk> of odessa oblast in ukraine . == career == gaidar graduated with honors from the moscow state university , faculty of economics , in <year> and worked as a researcher in several academic institutes . a long-time member of the communist party of the soviet union and an editor of the cpsu ideological journal communist during the perestroika , he joined boris yeltsin 's camp during perestroika . in <year> he quit the communist party and was promoted to yeltsin 's government . while in government , gaidar advocated free market economic reforms according to the principle of shock therapy . his best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state , which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially <unk> a market economy in russia . he also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies , and reduced the budget deficit . gaidar was the first <unk> of the russian government and minister of economics from <year> until <year> , and minister of finance from <month> <year> until <month> <year> . he was appointed acting prime minister under president boris yeltsin in <year> from <integer> <month> until <integer> <month> , when the <unk> russian congress of people 's deputies refused to confirm gaidar in this position and viktor <unk> was eventually chosen as a compromise figure . gaidar continued to advise the new government . on <integer> <month> <year> , he was again appointed the first <unk> under <unk> as a deliberate <unk> to the opposition . he played an active role in the russian constitutional crisis of <year> . on <integer> <month> , he famously spoke live on russian television , then broadcasting from an emergency station near moscow , as there was fighting going on in the <unk> complex , calling on <unk> to gather to defend yeltsin 's government so that russia would not be `` turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades '' .in the <year> duma elections , in the aftermath of the crisis , gaidar led the <unk> bloc russia 's choice and was seen by some as a possible future prime minister . however , due to the bloc 's failure to win the <unk> of votes in the election , gaidar 's role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on <integer> <month> <year> . during the <year> nato bombing of yugoslavia yegor gaidar , boris <unk> and boris <unk> were in belgrade , yugoslavia on a mediation mission . === reforms controversy === gaidar was often criticized for imposing <unk> reforms in <year> with little care for their social impact ; however , it has to be understood that the country back then was at the brink of a famine . russia had no currency for buying import goods , at the same time , <unk> gave credits as the country was essentially bankrupt . the collapse of the soviet social system led to serious deterioration in living standards . millions of russians were <unk> into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive hyperinflation . moreover , the privatization and <unk> of state assets left over from the soviet union , which he played a big part in , led to much of the country 's wealth being <unk> to a small group of powerful business executives , later known as the russian oligarchs , for much less than what they were worth . the <unk> privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become <unk> specifically by <unk> the vast difference between old domestic prices for russian <unk> and the prices prevailing on the world market . because they <unk> billions of dollars in swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the russian economy , these oligarchs were dubbed `` <unk> . '' as society grew to <unk> these figures and <unk> the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms , gaidar was often held by russians as one of the men most responsible . on the other hand , the <unk> goods deficit of the soviet years disappeared and it became possible to buy all goods in the <unk> . per capita <unk> consumption under gaidar diminished by <decimal> % from <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to franklin <unk> writing in the atlantic , however , `` when yegor gaidar ... asked the united states for help hunting down the billions that the kgb had <unk> away , the white house refused . `` one of gaidar 's most outspoken critics was the <unk> economist and mp <unk> <unk> , who had proposed since <year> a <integer> days programme for the transition of the whole ussr to market economic , which was first backed and then dismissed by the government of nikolai ryzhkov . <unk> emphasized the differences between his and gaidar 's reforms program , such as the <unk> of privatization vs. liberalization of prices and the <unk> of his program to the entire soviet union . gaidar 's supporters <unk> that although many mistakes were made , he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from <unk> and from starvation . according to the bbc 's andrei <unk> , `` there were only two <unk> introduce <unk> law and severe rationing , or radically <unk> the economy . the first option meant going all the way back to the stalinist system of mass repression . the second meant a <unk> change , a <unk> , rather , a <unk> <unk> waters with an <unk> outcome . '' === poisoning case === in <month> <year> gaidar went to <unk> , ireland to present his book <unk> of the empire : lessons for modern russia ' at an academic conference . shortly after <unk> , a fruit <unk> and a cup of tea , gaidar felt sick and returned from the conference hall to his room at the hotel . then he was called on the phone to come down and deliver his speech , what gaidar has later recalled as a call that saved his life , as he must had certainly died if were left in his room <unk> . after gaidar had tried to deliver his speech he collapsed in the university <unk> and was <unk> taken a to local hospital . his colleague , <unk> <unk> , recalled that `` he was lying on the floor <unk> . there was blood coming from his nose ; he was <unk> blood . this went on for more than half an hour '' <unk> day he moved from the hospital to the russian embassy 's premises and arranged a transfer to moscow where the doctors familiar with his health status suggested that it looks like he was <unk> a later interview that was published in the ft gaidar claimed that this has been an attempted political murder , where `` most likely that means that some obvious or hidden adversaries of the russian authorities stand behind the scenes of this event , those who are interested in further radical deterioration of relations between russia and the west '' <unk> russian reformist official and former colleague of gaidar , anatoly <unk> rejected a possibility of kremlin 's involvement in this case , commenting that `` yegor gaidar was on the <unk> of death on <integer> <month> . the deadly triangle - <unk> , <unk> and gaidar - would have been very desirable for some people who are seeking an unconstitutional and <unk> change of power in russia . '' irish police opened an official investigation of the case . one of the versions voiced by the russian opposition leaders and kremlin supporters suggested that boris <unk> , then a russian <unk> in exile , <month> have been behind it . <unk> <unk> , former putin 's adviser now living in the us , commented that the whole case was staged , and the reason for taking gaidar to hospital must have been <unk> , stress or <unk> . == death == gaidar died at the age of <integer> in <unk> <unk> , moscow oblast , russia . gaidar 's aide valery <unk> stated that gaidar died unexpectedly , early on <integer> <month> <year> , at his moscow oblast home while he was working on a book for children . gaidar died of <unk> <unk> , provoked by myocardial ischemia . he is survived by his wife , three sons and <unk> was regarded as an object of <unk> among ordinary russians who lost everything during the shock therapy economic <unk> russian <unk> mikhail <unk> and convicted <unk> <unk> lebedev expressed their condolences . `` he laid the foundation of our economy '' <unk> president dmitry medvedev has expressed condolences to relatives and friends of yegor gaidar . medvedev called gaidar a `` daring , honest and decisive '' economist who `` evoked respect among his supporters and opponents .

'' to the european congress of the regional science association in copenhagen , denmark . this paper , published in <year> , developed two concepts : the need to study the individual in order to understand social and group practices . modern cultural geographers commonly now study everyday practices on an <unk> basis , in order to understand larger scale patterns . the study of just groups creates a <unk> of reality and hides the truth . a link between space and time that had previously been <unk> developed . historically , social scientists had treated time as a relevant but external factor to spatial features . hägerstrand 's early work on innovation diffusion ( studying the geographical spread of new technologies ) made him realise that the two , though separate , were not independent of each other ; they have what french theorist henri <unk> would call a <unk> relationship . == legacy == hägerstrand 's initial work was primarily quantitative , which is important as the discipline of geography was , when he published his first paper in <year> , a highly descriptive subject . in the <year>s he was a pioneer of <unk> statistical primary data . he developed models and statistical techniques , such as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which later became important in the development of geographic information systems that process and <unk> movement data . his work informed the likes of allan <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who helped take it to the english speaking <unk> 's work contributed to the introduction of humanistic thought into geography , which led to the development of critical geography . while his early work was largely quantitative , hägerstrand 's later work paid closer attention to notions of <unk> and <unk> . still , his methods were critiqued by feminist geographer <unk> rose , who claimed that his models showed a <unk> and <unk> view of the world . more recent geographers have tried to combine time geography with the qualitative research and <unk> phenomenology of feminist geography . development of hägerstrand 's work has continued to form part of the basis for <unk> theory , and a <unk> of his work by new generations of social scientists and biologists means that he remains an influential thinker today . in <year> , <unk> <unk> summarized five benefits of hägerstrand 's time geography for contemporary social science : first , it provides a sense of <unk> , of the power of <unk> ' , and it does so in a <unk> is still the preserve of too few social theorists . all those intricate diagrams were , in part , an attempt to describe the pragmatics of events , a theme which has now , in the work of writers like <unk> , become fashionable in the social sciences and humanities but , at the time at which hägerstrand was working , tended to be restricted to the field of philosophy , except for the work of social <unk> and <unk> which was often very <unk> understood by other than a relatively small <unk> of <unk> . secondly , hägerstrand 's work was an attack on the <unk> idea that space and time were social <unk> , collective representations which both derived from society and also <unk> to society . [ ... ] <unk> makes it possible to go beyond social <unk> by emphasizing the physical constraints on human action and the wider networks of competing opportunities that they set up which act to <unk> situations . [ ... ] <unk> , and as a directly related point , those <unk> diagrams did something else too . they radically <unk> the distinction between humans and other objects . they provided a kind of <unk> of representation , even a democracy of description , of the world . [ ... ] <unk> , hägerstrand 's work espoused a geographical ethics , <unk> on the wise use of space and time . although hägerstrand would often use economic <unk> to describe that wisdom in the use of space and time , i am sure that he meant something broader and more encompassing which it seems to me to be well worth keeping hold of , a kind of democratic ethos of the cardinal dimensions , a <unk> in the use of space and time . <unk> , hägerstrand provided a language which could register the world in different ways . perhaps one way of looking at hägerstrand 's work is as a means of saying <unk> ' in a language many can understand : drawing as a kind of visual <unk> . == honors == he received honorary doctorates from university of <unk> , norwegian school of economics and business administration , norwegian university of science and technology , university of bristol , university of edinburgh , university of glasgow and ohio state university . the <unk> accompanying the honorary degree at ohio state university noted that `` his work on innovation diffusion , carried out in the <year>s and <year>s , continues to be cited as a standard against which current research is measured '' and that `` this distinguished individual ... inspired a generation of scholars around the world .

children with cerebral palsy and developmental disorders . he discovered the principle of reflex locomotion , which is used to treat various physical and neuromuscular disorders through the

reflex locomotion therapy , particularly in the treatment of children <unk> developmental <unk> . he discovered the basis of reflex locomotion while searching for treatment therapies for children with cerebral palsy and <unk> paralysis . he discovered that muscle groups that the children could not <unk> themselves can be <unk> by applying pressure to specific zones on a patient ’ s body . repeated <unk> resulted in improved <unk> , better posture and improved speech in children with cerebral palsy . professor vojta recognized that many of the movement complexes he found could be traced to common subjective global patterns of movement that mark developmental <unk> in healthy children . although the emphasis of vojta ’ s work was initially directed to pediatrics , he very soon recognized that the treatment could also be applied to neurological problems in adult patients . however , vojta therapy is most effective in patients under the age of six months , an age when early developmental changes are most profound . vojta <unk> use a combination of <integer> different zones on a patient 's body , applying light pressure on a specific area and resistance to the current movement , causing the patient 's body to <unk> perform certain <unk> movement patterns . repeated stimulation appears to make previously blocked neurological connections between the patient 's spinal cord and brain . the patient is eventually able to perform similar movements without any external stimulation . vojta therapy has been used to treat cerebral palsy , peripheral paralysis of the arms and legs , <unk> <unk> , and problems in breathing , <unk> and <unk> . in recent years , the principles underlying vojta 's method have been adapted to dynamic neuromuscular stimulation or dns , a modern <unk> of vojta therapy . dns therapy has been successfully used to <unk> <unk> injury and enhance performance , leading to a reduction in injury , decreased recovery time , and increased performance <unk> . when an adult <unk> or patient is injured , they sometimes <unk> to an early pattern of locomotion similar to that of a young infant , before proper control was established . for example , a patient with a <unk> <unk> <month> internally <unk> and <unk> their arm in a way similar to a <unk> child who has not yet developed external rotation and extension . in this case , dns places an adult patient in a developmental position to <unk> proper control of the <unk> joint . while vojta therapy has been recognized for decades as a <unk> treatment method throughout europe and

the third child of howard w. odum , an american sociologist , and his wife , anna louise ( née <unk> ) odum ( <year>–1965 ) . he was the younger brother of eugene odum . their father `` encouraged his sons to go into science and to develop new techniques to contribute to social progress '' . howard learned his early scientific lessons about birds from his brother , fish and the philosophy of biology while working after school for marine zoologist robert <unk> , and electrical circuits from the boy <unk> by alfred powell <unk> thomas studied biology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill , where he published his first paper while still an undergraduate . his education was interrupted for three years by his world war ii service with the army air force in puerto rico and the <unk> canal zone , where he worked as a tropical <unk> . after the war , he returned to the university of north carolina and completed his b.s . in zoology ( phi beta kappa ) in <year> . in <year> , odum married virginia wood , and they later had two children . after wood 's death in <year> , he married elisabeth c. odum ( who had four children from her previous marriage ) in <year>. odum 's advice on how to <unk> a blended family was to be sure to keep talking ; elisabeth 's was to hold back on discipline and new <unk> <year> , odum earned his ph.d. in zoology at yale university , under the guidance of g. evelyn hutchinson . his dissertation was titled the <unk> of strontium : with discussion on the ecological integration of elements , which brought him into the emerging field of systems ecology . he made a meteorological `` analysis of the global circulation of strontium , [ and ] anticipated in the late <year>s the view of the earth as one great ecosystem '' <unk> at yale , howard began his lifelong collaborations with his brother eugene . in <year> , they published the first english-language textbook on systems ecology , fundamentals of ecology . howard wrote the chapter on energetics , which introduced his energy circuit language . they continued to collaborate in research as well as writing for the rest of their lives . for howard , his energy systems language ( which he called `` <unk> '' ) was itself a collaborative tool . from <year> to <year> , odum worked as the director of the marine institute of the university of texas . during this time , he became aware of the interplay of <unk> and economic forces . he taught in the department of zoology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill , and was one of the professors in the new curriculum of marine sciences until <year> . that year he moved to the university of florida , where he taught in the environmental engineering sciences department , founded and directed the center for environmental policy , and founded the university 's center for wetlands in <year> ; it was the first center of its kind in the world that is still in operation today . odum continued this work for <integer> years until his retirement in <year> . in the <year>s and <year>s , odum was also chairman of the international biological program 's tropical <unk> planning committee . he was supported by large contracts with the united states atomic energy commission , resulting in participation by nearly <integer> scientists , who conducted radiation studies of a tropical rainforest . his featured project at university of florida in the <year>s was on <unk> treated <unk> into cypress <unk> . this was one of the first projects to explore the now widespread approach of using wetlands as water quality improvement ecosystems . this is one of his most important contributions to the beginnings of the field of ecological engineering . in his last years , odum was graduate research professor emeritus and director of the center for environmental policy . he was an avid birdwatcher in both his professional and personal life . the ecological society awarded odum its <unk> award to recognize his contributions to the study of the coral <unk> on eniwetok atoll . odum also received the french prix de vie , and the crafoord prize of the royal swedish academy of science , considered the nobel equivalent for <unk> . charles a. s. hall described odum as one of the most innovative and important thinkers of the time . hall noted that odum , either alone or with his brother eugene , received essentially all international prizes awarded to ecologists . the only higher education institute to award honorary degrees to both odum brothers was ohio state university , which honored howard in <year> and <unk> in <year> . odum 's contributions to ecosystems ecology have been recognized by the mars society , who named their experimental station the `` h. t. odum greenhouse '' at the suggestion of his former student patrick kangas . kangas and his student , david <unk> , made significant contributions to the design of the waste water <unk> system on the station . odum 's students

united states environmental protection agency , <unk> <unk> at the <unk> in brazil , and sergio <unk> at the university of <unk> . work done at these institutions continues to evolve and propagate the odum 's concept of emergy . his former students bill mitsch , robert <unk> , and <unk> <unk> are some former students who have been recognized internationally for their contributions to ecological engineering , ecological economics , ecosystem science , wetland ecology , <unk> ecology , ecological modeling , and related fields . == work : an overview == odum left a large legacy in many fields associated with ecology , systems , and energetics . he studied ecosystems all over the world , and pioneered the study of several areas , some of which are now distinct fields of research . according to hall ( <year> , <unk> ) , odum published one of the first significant papers in each of the following areas : ecological modeling ( odum <year>a ) ecological engineering ( odum et al . <year> ) ecological economics ( odum <year> ) <unk> ecology ( odum and <unk> <year> ) tropical ecosystems ecology ( odum and pidgeon <year> ) general systems <unk> 's contributions to these and other areas are summarized below . odum also wrote on radiation ecology , systems ecology , unified science , and the microcosm . he was one of the first to discuss the use of ecosystems for <unk> function in space travel . some have suggested that odum was technocratic in orientation , while others believe that he sided with those calling for `` new values '' . == ecological modeling == === a new <unk> approach in ecology === in his <year> ph.d. thesis , odum gave a novel definition of ecology as the study of large entities ( ecosystems ) at the `` natural level of integration '' . in the traditional role of an ecologist , one of odum 's doctoral aims was to recognize and <unk> large <unk> entities ( ecosystems ) . however , another one of his aims was to make <unk> generalizations about ecosystems , such as the whole world for example . for odum , as a large entity , the world constituted a <unk> cycle with high stability . it was the presence of stability , which odum believed enabled him to talk about the <unk> of such systems . while he was writing his thesis , odum felt that the principle of natural selection was more than empirical , because it had a <unk> , `` stability over time '' component . as an ecologist interested in the behavior and function of large entities over time , odum sought to give a more general statement of natural selection so that it was equally applicable to large entities as it was to small entities traditionally studied in <unk> also wanted to extend the scope and <unk> of natural selection to include large entities such as the world . this extension relied on the definition of an entity as a combination of properties that have some stability with time . odum 's approach was motivated by <unk> 's idea 's on the energetics of evolution . === ecosystem simulation === odum used an analog of electrical energy networks to model the energy flow <unk> of ecosystems . his analog electrical models had a significant role in the development of his approach to systems and have been recognized as one of the earliest instances of systems <unk> flow in the electrical network represented the flow of material ( e.g . carbon ) in the ecosystem , charge in a <unk> was analogous to storage of a material , and the model was <unk> to the ecosystem of interest by <unk> the size of electrical component . === ecological analog of ohm 's law === in the <year>s odum introduced his electrical circuit diagrams of ecosystems to the ecological society of america . he claimed that energy was driven through ecological systems by an `` <unk> '' analogous to the role of voltage in electrical <unk> developed an analogue of ohm 's law which aimed to be a representation of energy flows through ecosystems . in terms of steady state thermodynamics , ohm 's law can be considered a special case of a more general flux law , where the flux ( j { \displaystyle j } ) `` is proportional to the driving thermodynamic force ( x { \displaystyle x } ) with <unk> ( c { \displaystyle c } ) '' , or j = c x { \displaystyle <unk> } <unk> states that odum concluded that as thermodynamic systems , ecosystems should also obey the <unk> law , and that ohm 's law and passive electrical analog circuits can be used to simulate ecosystems . in this simulation , odum attempted to derive an ecological analog for electrical voltage . voltage , or driving force , is related to the biomass in pounds per acre . the analogous concept required is the biomass activity , that is , the thermodynamic thrust , which <month> be linear . exactly what this is in nature is still uncertain , as it is a new concept . such a consideration led odum to ask two important methodological questions : what is the electrical significance of a function observed in nature ? given an electrical unit in a circuit , what is it in the ecological system ? for example , what is a <unk> in nature ? one needs a <unk> to allow biomass to <unk> after the voltage of the sun has gone down , or else the circuit <unk> . higher organisms like fish are <unk> . === the silver springs study === silver springs is a common type of <unk> stream in florida with a constant temperature and chemical composition . the study odum conducted here was the first complete analysis of a natural <unk> started with an overall model and in his early work used a <unk> methodology very similar to the <unk> diagrams used in chemical process <unk> from that overall model , odum `` <unk> in detail all the flow routes to and from the stream . he measured the energy input of sun and rain , and of all organic matter - even those of the bread the <unk> threw to the ducks and fish - and then measured the energy that gradually left the spring . in this way he was able to establish the stream 's energy budget . '' === ecological and biological energetics === around <year> odum directed studies into <unk> , which included the effects of radiation on the tropical rainforest in el verde , puerto rico ( odum and pidgeon ) , and the coral <unk> and ocean ecology at eniwetok atoll . the odum brothers were approached by the atomic energy commission to undertake a detailed study of the atoll after nuclear testing ; the atoll was sufficiently radioactive that upon their arrival the <unk> were able to produce an <unk> image of a coral head by placing it on photographic paper . these studies were early applications of energy concepts to ecological systems , and explored the implications of the laws of thermodynamics when used in these new <unk> this view , <unk> cycles are driven by <unk> energy . odum expressed the balance between energy input and output as the ratio of production ( p ) to respiration ( r ) : <unk> he classified water bodies based on their <unk> ratios , which separated <unk> from <unk> ecosystems : `` [ odum 's ] measurements of flowing water metabolism were measurements of whole systems . odum was measuring the community as a system , not adding up the metabolism of the components as <unk> and many others had done '' . this reasoning appears to have followed that of odum 's doctoral supervisor , g. e. hutchinson , who thought that if a community were an organism then it must have a form of metabolism . however , golley notes that odum attempted to go beyond the reporting of mere ratios , a move which resulted in the first serious disagreement in systems energetics . === maximum power theory and the proposal for additional laws of <unk> === in a controversial move , odum and richard <unk> ( at the time physicist at the university of florida ) were motivated by alfred j. <unk> 's articles on the energetics of evolution , and subsequently proposed the theory that natural systems tend to operate at an efficiency that produces the maximum power output , not the maximum efficiency . === energy systems language === by the end of the <year>s , odum 's electronic circuit ecological simulation models were replaced by a more general set of energy symbols . when combined to form systems diagrams , these symbols were considered by odum and others to be the language of the macroscope which could portray generalized patterns of energy flow : `` describing such patterns and reducing ecosystem <unk> to flows of energy , odum believed , would permit discovery of general ecosystem principles . '' some have attempted to link it with the universal scientific language projects which have appeared throughout the history of natural philosophy . <unk> claimed that the language was a direct result of working with analogue computers , and reflected an electrical engineer 's approach to the problem of system representation : `` because of its electrical analogy , the odum system is relatively easy to turn into mathematical equations ... if one is building a model of energy flow then certainly the odum system should be given serious consideration ... `` === emergy === in the <year>s in the latter part of his career , odum and david m. <unk> developed the idea of emergy as a specific use of the term embodied energy . some consider the concept of `` emergy '' , sometimes briefly defined as `` energy memory '' , as one of odum 's more significant contributions , but the concept is neither free from controversy nor without its critics . odum looked at natural systems as being formed by the use of various forms of energy in the past : `` emergy is a measure of energy used in the past and thus is different from a measure of energy now . the unit of emergy ( past available energy use ) is the <unk> , as distinguished from <unk> used for available energy remaining now . '' this was conceived as a principle of maximum <unk> , which might explain the evolution of <unk> open systems . however , the principle has only been demonstrated in a few experiments and is not widely recognized in the scientific community . == ecosystem ecology and systems ecology == for j. b. hagen , the maximum power principle , and the stability principle could be easily translated into the language of homeostasis and cybernetics systems . hagen claims that the feedback loops in ecosystems were , for odum , analogous to the kinds of feedback loops <unk> in electronic circuits and cybernetic systems . this approach represented the migration of cybernetic ideas into ecology and led to the formulation of systems ecology . in odum 's work these concepts form part of what hagen called an , `` ambitious and idiosyncratic attempt to create a universal science of systems '' . === macroscope === hagen identified the systems , thinking of odum as a form of holistic thinking , who contrasted the holistic thinking of systems science with <unk> microscopic thinking , and used the term macroscope to refer to the holistic view , which was a kind of `` detail <unk> '' allowing a simple diagram to be created . === microcosms === odum was a pioneer in his use of small closed and open ecosystems in classroom teaching , which were often constructed from fish tanks or <unk> and have been called microcosms . <unk> studies influenced the design of biosphere <integer> . == ecological economics == ecological economics is an active field between economics and ecology with annual conferences , international societies , and an international journal . from <year> to <year> , odum worked as director of the marine institute of the university of texas . during this time odum became aware of the interplay of <unk> and economic forces . he therefore funded the research into the use of conventional economic approaches to <unk> dollar values of ecological resources for recreational , treatment and other uses . this research calculated the potential value of primary production per bay surface <unk> hall the importance of odum 's work came through his integration of systems , ecology , and energy with economics , together with odum 's view that economics can be <unk> on objective terms such as energy rather than on a subjective , willingness to pay basis . == ecological engineering == ecological engineering is an emerging field of study between ecology and engineering concerned with the designing , monitoring and constructing of ecosystems . the term ecological engineering was first coined by odum in <year> , before he worked at the university of florida . ecological engineering , he wrote , is `` those cases where the energy <unk> by man is small relative to the natural sources but sufficient to produce large effects in the resulting patterns and processes . '' ecological engineering as a practical field was developed by his former graduate student bill mitsch , who started and continues to edit the standard journal in the field and helped to start both international and u.s. societies devoted to ecological engineering , and has written two textbooks on the subject one of odum 's last papers was his assessment of ecological engineering that was published in the journal ecological engineering in <year> , a year after odum died . == general systems theory == in <year> , odum was elected the <days> president of the international society for the systems sciences , formerly named the international society for general systems research . he presented many papers on the general systems theory at its annual conferences , and edited the last published general systems <unk> . the second , revised edition of his major <unk> was <unk> ecological and general systems : an introduction to systems ecology ( <year> ) . some of his energy models and simulations contained general systems components . odum has been described as a `` technocratic <unk> '' , and his approach was significantly influenced by his father , who was also an advocate of viewing the social world through the various <unk> of physical science . within the processes on earth , odum ( <year> ) believed humans play a central role : he said that the `` human is the biosphere 's <unk> and pragmatic information <unk> for maximum performance '' . == publications == odum wrote around <integer> books and <integer> papers , and a festschrift volume ( maximum power : the ideas and applications of h. t. odum , <year> ) was published in honor of his <unk> was also honored by the journal ecological engineering for his contributions to the field of ecological engineering and general ecology in recognition of his <days> birthday . the publication included over <integer> letters from distinguished scientists from all over the world including mitsch ( lead editorial ) , john allen , robert <unk> , robert beyers , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , sandra brown , ramon margalef , paul <unk> , eugene odum , <unk> ewel , kenneth <unk> , pat kangas , <unk> <unk> , bob knight , <unk> wang , john teal , frank golley , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , joan <unk> , carl <unk> , richard <unk> , scott nixon , gene turner , john <unk> , and james <unk> . === books === <year> , environment , power and society for the twenty-first century : the hierarchy of energy , with mark t. brown , columbia university press . <year> , a prosperous way down : principles and policies , with elisabeth c. odum , university press of colorado . <year> , with e. c. odum , modeling for all scales : an introduction to system simulation , academic press . <year> , heavy metals in the environment : using wetlands for their removal . <year> , biosphere <integer> : research , past and present , with bruno d. v. <unk> . <year> , environmental accounting : emergy and environmental decision making . <year> , ecological microcosms , with robert j. beyers . <year> , cypress <unk> with katherine c. ewel . <year> , systems ecology : an introduction . <year> , energy basis for man and nature , with elisabeth c. odum . <year> , with robert f. pigeon ( eds ) , a tropical rain forest ;

have different information about the parameters of the game . he resolved the problem of how players could make decisions while not knowing what each other knows by modelling the situation with initial moves by nature using known probabilities to choose the parameters , with some players observing nature 's move but other players just knowing the probabilities and the fact that some players have observed the actual realized values . this relies on assuming that all players know the structure of the game , which means they all have `` common <unk> '' , knowing the probabilities nature

of the <unk> brothers chain . walton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success . according to walton , if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car , people would shop at home . walton made sure the <unk> were consistently <unk> with a wide range of goods . his second store , the tiny `` eagle '' department store , was down the street from his first ben franklin and next door to its main <unk> in newport . with the sales volume growing from $ <other>0,000 to $ <unk> in three years , walton drew the attention of the <unk> , p. k. holmes , whose family had a history in retail . <unk> sam 's great success , and desiring to <unk> the store ( and franchise rights ) for his son , he refused to <unk> the lease . the lack of a renewal option , together with the <unk> high rent of <integer> % of sales , were early business lessons to walton . despite forcing walton out , holmes bought the store 's inventory and <unk> for $ <other>0,000 , which walton called `` a fair price '' . with a year left on the lease , but the store effectively sold , he , his wife helen and his father-in-law managed to negotiate the purchase of a new location on the downtown square of bentonville , arkansas . walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store , and the title to the building , on the condition that he get a <unk> lease to expand into the shop next door . the owner of the shop next door refused six times , and walton gave up on bentonville when his father-in-law , without sam 's knowledge , paid the shop owner a final visit and $ <other>0,000 to secure the lease . he had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal , and <unk> helen 's father . they opened for business with a <unk> <unk> sale on <month> <integer> , <unk> he bought the bentonville store , it was doing $ <unk> in sales and it increased to $ <unk> in the first year and then $ <unk> and $ <unk> . == a chain of ben franklin stores == with the new bentonville `` five and <unk> '' opening for business , and <integer> miles away , a year left on the lease in newport , the <unk> young walton had to learn to delegate <unk> succeeding with two stores at such a distance ( and with the postwar baby boom in full effect ) , sam became enthusiastic about scouting more locations and opening more ben franklin <unk> . ( also , having spent countless hours behind the <unk> , and with his close brother james `` bud '' walton having been a pilot in the war , he decided to buy a small <unk> airplane . both he and his son john would later become accomplished pilots and <unk> thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business . ) in <year> , he opened a store with his brother bud in a <unk> center in ruskin heights , a suburb of kansas city , missouri . with the help of his brother and father-in-law , sam went on to open many new variety stores . he encouraged his managers to invest and take an <unk> stake in the business , often as much as $ <year> in their store , or the next <unk> to open . ( this motivated the managers to <unk> their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise . ) by <year> , along with his brother bud , he owned <integer> stores in arkansas , missouri , and kansas ( fifteen ben franklin 's and one independent , in <unk> ) <unk> walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry . he had a great passion for learning . he frequently made <unk> visits to walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other walmarts . on one of those visits he was puzzled by a <unk> saying “ <unk> ” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing . the <unk> explained that his main job was to <unk> <unk> from taking <unk> merchandise out of the store through the entrance . walton was <unk> and shared the innovation with “ associates ” throughout his chain . == first walmart == the first true walmart opened on <month> <integer> , <year> , in rogers , arkansas . called the wal-mart discount city store , it was located at <integer> west <unk> street . he launched a determined effort to market <unk> products . included in the effort was a willingness to find american manufacturers who could supply merchandise for the entire walmart chain at a price low enough to meet the foreign <unk> the <unk> store chain grew , it caught the attention of walton . he came to acknowledge that his <unk> center <unk> was based on <unk> 's original innovative concept . contrary to the prevailing practice of american discount store chains , walton located stores in smaller towns , not larger cities . to be near consumers , the only option at the time was to open <unk> in small towns . walton 's model offered two advantages . first , existing competition was limited and secondly , if a store was large enough to control business in a town and its surrounding areas , other merchants would be <unk> from entering the <unk> make his model work , he emphasized <unk> , particularly <unk> stores within a day 's drive of walmart 's regional <unk> , and distributed through its own <unk> service . buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise . thus , sustained <unk> <year> 's <integer> stores to <year> 's <unk> <unk> its scale and economic influence , walmart is noted to significantly impact any region in which it <unk> a store . these <unk> , both positive and negative , have been dubbed the `` walmart effect '' . == personal life == walton married helen robson on <unk> 's day , <month> <integer> , <year>. they had four children : samuel robson ( rob ) born in <year> , john thomas ( <year>–2005 ) , james <unk> ( jim ) born in <year> , and alice louise born in <unk> supported various <unk> causes . he and helen were active in <days> presbyterian church in bentonville ; sam served as an elder and a <dayofweek> school teacher , teaching high school age students . the family made substantial contributions to the <unk> . walton worked the concept of “ service leadership ” into the corporate structure of walmart based on the concept of christ being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in christianity . === death === walton died on <dayofweek> , <month> <integer> , <year> ( three months <unk> of walmart 's <unk> anniversary ) , of multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer , in little rock , arkansas . the news of his death was <unk> by satellite to all <unk> walmart stores . at the time , his company employed <other>80,000 people . annual sales of nearly $ <integer> billion <unk> from <unk> walmarts , <integer> sam 's <unk> , and <integer> <unk> remains are interred at the bentonville cemetery . he left his ownership in walmart to his wife and their children : rob walton succeeded his father as the chairman of walmart , and john walton was a director until his death in a <year> plane crash . the others are not directly involved in the company ( except through their voting power as shareholders ) , however his son jim walton is chairman of <unk> bank . the walton family held five <unk> in the top ten richest people in the united states until <year>. two daughters of sam 's brother bud <unk> <unk> and nancy <unk> smaller shares in the company . == legacy == in <year> , walton was included in time 's list of <integer> most influential people of the <days> century . walton was honored for his work in retail in <month> <year> , just one month before his death , when he received the presidential medal of freedom from <unk> george h. w. <unk> ranked sam walton as the richest person in the united states from <year> to <year> , <unk> the top spot to john <unk> in <year> when the editors began to credit walton 's fortune jointly to him and his four children .

person interview conducted on <month> <integer> , <year> , with frank robson , brother-in-law of sam walton . < end_of_passage > < start_of_passage > william donald hamilton ( <integer> <month> <year> – <integer> <month> <year> ) was a british evolutionary biologist , widely recognised as one of the most significant evolutionary theorists of the <days> <unk> became famous through his theoretical work <unk> a rigorous genetic basis for the existence of <unk> , an insight that was a key part of the development of the <unk> view of evolution . he is considered one of the <unk> of <unk> . hamilton also published important work on sex ratios and the evolution of sex . from <year> to his death in <year> , he was a royal society research professor at oxford university . == early life == hamilton was born in <year> in cairo , egypt , the second of seven children . his parents were from new zealand ; his father a. m. hamilton was an engineer , and his mother b. m. hamilton was a medical doctor . the hamilton family settled in kent . during the second world war , the young hamilton was evacuated to edinburgh . he had an interest in natural history from an early age and spent his spare time collecting butterflies and other insects . in <year> , he discovered e. b. ford 's new naturalist book butterflies , which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection , genetics , and population genetics . he was educated at <unk> school , where he was in <unk> house . as a <unk> , he was seriously injured while playing with explosives his father had that were left over from making hand <unk> for the home guard during world war ii . hamilton had to have a <unk> and fingers on his right hand had to be <unk> in king 's college hospital to save his life . he was left with <unk> and needed six months to recover . before going up to the university of cambridge , he travelled in france and completed two years of national service . as an undergraduate at st. john 's college , he was <unk> by the `` many biologists [ who ] hardly seemed to believe in evolution '' . he was intrigued by ronald fisher 's book the genetical theory of natural selection , but fisher lacked standing at cambridge , being viewed as only a statistician . hamilton was excited by fisher 's chapters on <unk> . in earlier chapters , fisher provided a mathematical basis for the genetics of evolution and hamilton later blamed fisher 's book for his getting only a <unk> degree . == hamilton 's rule == hamilton enrolled in an msc course in demography at the london school of economics ( lse ) , under norman carrier , who helped secure various grants for his studies . later , when his work became more mathematical and genetical , he had his supervision transferred to john <unk> of the lse and <unk> smith of university college london ( ucl ) . both fisher and j. b. s. haldane had seen a problem in how organisms could increase the fitness of their own genes by <unk> their close relatives , but not recognised its significance or properly formulated it . hamilton worked through several examples , and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was sewall wright 's coefficient of relationship . this became hamilton 's rule : in each <unk> situation , the individual <unk> his <unk> 's fitness against his own according to the <unk> of relationship appropriate to the situation . <unk> , the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if : where c is the cost in fitness to the actor , r the genetic <unk> between the actor and the recipient , and b is the fitness benefit to the recipient . fitness costs and benefits are measured in <unk> . r is a number between <integer> and <decimal> his two <year> papers entitled the genetical evolution of social behaviour are now widely <unk> proof and discussion of its consequences , however , involved detailed mathematics , and two <unk> passed over the paper . the third , john <month>nard smith , did not completely understand it either , but recognised its significance . having his work passed over later led to friction between hamilton and <month>nard smith , as hamilton thought smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea ( during the review period <month>nard smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas ) . the hamilton paper was printed in the journal of theoretical biology and , when first published , was largely ignored . recognition of its significance gradually increased to the point that it is now routinely cited in biology books . much of the discussion relates to the evolution of <unk> in insects of the order <unk> ( <unk> , bees and wasps ) based on their unusual <unk> <unk> system . this system means that females are more closely related to their sisters than to their own ( potential ) <unk> . thus , hamilton <unk> , a `` costly action '' would be better spent in helping to raise their sisters , rather than <unk> themselves . == spiteful behaviour == in his <year> paper selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model hamilton considers the question of whether <unk> inflicted upon an organism must inevitably be a <unk> of adaptations for survival . what of possible cases where an organism is deliberately <unk> others without apparent benefit to the <unk> ? such behaviour hamilton calls spiteful . it can be explained as the increase in the chance of an organism 's genetic <unk> to be passed to the next generations by <unk> those that are less closely related than relationship by chance . spite , however , is unlikely ever to be elaborated into any complex forms of adaptation . targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge , and the majority of <unk> of individuals ( assuming a <unk> species ) exhibit a roughly average level of genetic <unk> , making the selection of targets of spite <unk> . == extraordinary sex ratios == between <year> and <year> hamilton was a lecturer at imperial college london . whilst there he published a paper in science on `` extraordinary sex ratios '' . fisher ( <year> ) had proposed a model as to why `` ordinary '' sex ratios were nearly always <unk> ( but see edwards <year> ) , and likewise extraordinary sex ratios , particularly in wasps , needed <unk> . hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in <year> when he had been assigned to help fisher 's pupil <unk> . edwards test the <unk> sex ratio hypothesis . hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem , opening up a whole new area of research . the paper was also notable for introducing the concept of the `` <unk> strategy '' , which john <month>nard smith and george r. price were to develop into the evolutionarily stable strategy ( <unk> ) , a concept in game theory not limited to evolutionary biology . price had originally come to hamilton after deriving the price equation , and thus <unk> hamilton 's rule . <month>nard smith later peer reviewed one of price 's papers , and drew inspiration from it . the paper was not published but <month>nard smith offered to make price a co-author of his <unk> paper , which helped to improve relations between the men . price committed suicide in <year> , and hamilton and <month>nard smith were among the few present at the <unk> was regarded as a poor lecturer . this <unk> would not affect the popularity of his work , however , as it was popularised by richard dawkins in dawkins ' <year> book the selfish gene . in <year> he married christine <unk> and they were to have three daughters , helen , ruth and <unk> . <integer> years later they <unk> separated . hamilton was a visiting professor at harvard university and later spent nine months with the royal society 's and the royal geographical society 's <unk> expedition as a visiting professor at the university of são paulo . from <year> hamilton was professor of evolutionary biology at the university of michigan . simultaneously , he was elected a foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences . his arrival sparked protests and <unk> from students who did not like his association with <unk> . there he worked with the political scientist robert axelrod on the prisoner 's dilemma , and was a member of the bach group with original members arthur <unk> , robert axelrod , michael cohen , and john holland . == <unk> the red queen == hamilton was an early proponent of the red queen theory of the evolution of sex ( separate from the other theory of the same name previously proposed by <unk> van <unk> ) . this was named for a character in lewis carroll 's through the <unk> , who is continuously running but never actually travels any distance : `` well , in our country , '' said alice , still <unk> a little , `` you 'd generally get to somewhere <unk> you ran very fast for a long time , as we 've been doing . '' `` a slow sort of country ! '' said the queen . `` now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place . if you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that ! '' ( carroll , pp . <integer> ) this theory hypothesizes that sex evolved because new and unfamiliar combinations of genes could be presented to parasites , preventing the <unk> from <unk> on that organism : species with sex were able to continuously `` run away '' from their parasites . likewise , parasites were able to evolve mechanisms to get around the organism 's new set of genes , thus <unk> an <unk> race . == return to britain == in <year> , he was elected a fellow of the royal society , and in <year> , he was invited by richard southwood to be the royal society research professor in the department of zoology at oxford , and a fellow of new college , where he remained until his death . from <year> , hamilton found <unk> with maria <unk> <unk> , an italian science journalist and author . his collected papers , entitled narrow roads of gene land , began to be published in <year>. the first volume was entitled evolution of social behaviour . == social evolution == the field of social evolution , of which hamilton 's rule has central importance , is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours , i.e . those that impact on the fitness of individuals other than the actor . social behaviours can be <unk> according to the fitness consequences they <unk> for the actor and recipient . a behaviour that increases the direct fitness of the actor is mutually beneficial if the recipient also benefits , and selfish if the recipient suffers a loss . a behaviour that reduces the fitness of the actor is <unk> if the recipient benefits , and spiteful if the recipient suffers a loss . this classification was first proposed by hamilton in <unk> also proposed the <unk> theory of autumn <unk> color as an example of evolutionary signalling theory . == expedition to the congo == during the <year>s , hamilton became increasingly interested in the controversial argument that the origin of <unk> lay in oral polio <unk> trials conducted by hilary <unk> in africa during the <year>s . a letter by hamilton on the topic to the major peer-reviewed journal science was rejected in <year>. despite this rejection , he gave supportive <unk> on the hypothesis to the bbc and wrote the foreword of a <year> book , the river , by journalist edward hooper , who investigated the hypothesis . to look for indirect evidence of the <unk> hypothesis by assessing natural levels of <unk> <unk> virus , in primates , in early <year> , hamilton and two others <unk> on a field trip to the <unk> democratic republic of the congo . however , none of the over <integer> urine and <unk> samples collected by hamilton contained <unk> <unk> virus . == death == he returned to london from africa on <integer> <month> <year>. he was admitted to university college hospital , london , on <integer> <month> <year>. he was transferred to middlesex hospital on <integer> <month> <year> and died there on <integer> <month> <year>. an <unk> was held on <integer> <month> <year> at westminster <unk> 's court to <unk> into rumours about the cause of his death . the <unk> concluded that his death was due to `` <unk> failure due to upper <unk> <unk> due to a <unk> <unk> and <unk> bleed through a <unk> <unk> '' . following reports <unk> his death to complications arising from malaria , the bbc editorial complaints unit 's investigation established that he had contracted malaria during his final african expedition . however , the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the <unk> and <unk> <unk> had resulted from a <unk> ( which might have been taken because of <unk> symptoms ) <unk> in the <unk> ; but , even if this suggestion were correct , the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely <unk> secular memorial service ( he was an agnostic ) was held at the chapel of new college , oxford on <integer> <month> <year> , organised by richard dawkins . he was buried near <unk> woods . he , however , had written an essay on my intended burial and why in which he wrote : i will leave a sum in my last will for my body to be carried to brazil and to these forests . it will be laid out in a manner secure against the <unk> and the <unk> just as we make our <unk> secure ; and this great <unk> <unk> will bury me . they will enter , will bury , will live on my <unk> ; and in the shape of their children and mine , i will escape death . no <unk> for me nor <unk> fly , i will buzz in the <unk> like a huge <unk> bee . i will be many , buzz even as a <unk> of <unk> , be <unk> , body by flying body out into the brazilian wilderness <unk> the stars , <unk> under those beautiful and <unk> <unk> which we will all hold over our backs . so finally i too will <unk> like a <unk> ground <unk> under a stone . the second volume of his collected papers , evolution of sex , was published in <year> , and the third and final volume , last words , in <year> . == awards == <year> foreign honorary member of american academy of arts and sciences <year> fellow of the royal society of london <year> <unk> cleveland prize of the american association for the advancement of science <year> darwin medal of the royal society of london <year> scientific medal of the linnean society <year> <unk> medal of zoological society of london <unk> <unk> prize of the university of bern <year> crafoord prize of the royal swedish academy of sciences <year> kyoto prize of the <unk> foundation <year> <unk> prize of the <unk> foundation <year> honorary title of academician of science in finland <year> member of the american philosophical society == biographies == alan <unk> has written a biographical memoir for the royal society . a biographical book has also been published by <unk> <unk> : <unk> , u . <year>. nature 's <unk> : the life and work of w. d. hamilton . oxford university press . == works == === collected papers === hamilton started to publish his collected papers starting in <year> , along the lines of fisher 's collected papers , with short essays giving each paper context . he died after the preparation of the second volume , so the essays for the third volume come from his coauthors . hamilton w.d .

a `` managerial revolution '' in the visible hand : the managerial revolution in american business ( <year> ) for which he received a pulitzer prize . he pursued that book 's themes further in scale

== the visible hand == chandler 's <unk> was the visible hand : the managerial revolution in american business ( <year> ) . his first two chapters looked at traditional <unk> small business operations in commerce and production , including the largest among them , the <unk> <unk> in the south . chapters <other>-5 <unk> the history of railroad management , with stress on innovations not just in

corporate structure of the biggest firms , standard oil , general electric , us steel , and dupont ( ch <unk> ) . chandler argued that managerial firms evolved in order to take advantage of <unk> techniques available after the rail network was in place . these firms had a higher productivity and lower costs resulting in higher profits . the firms created the `` managerial class '' in america because they needed to coordinate the increasingly complex and <unk> system . according to steven <unk> , this ability to achieve efficiency through coordination , and not some <unk> <unk> greed by

electricity created a second industrial revolution , which resulted in much more <unk> industries than had the industrial revolution of the previous century . the mobilization of the capital necessary to <unk> these new systems required a larger number of workers and managers , and larger physical plants than ever before . more particularly , the thesis of the visible hand is that , counter to other theses regarding how capitalism functions , administrative structure and managerial coordination replaced adam smith 's `` invisible hand '' ( market forces ) as the core developmental and <unk> impetus of modern business . in the wake of this increase of industrial scale , three successful models of capitalism emerged , which chandler associated with the three leading countries of the period : great britain ( `` personal capitalism '' ) , the united states ( `` competitive capitalism '' ) and germany ( `` cooperative capitalism . '' ) despite the important differences in these three models , the common <unk> among the developed nations is that the large industrial firm has been the engine of growth in three ways : first , it has provided focal points for capital and labor on large scales ; second , it became the educator whereby a nation learned the <unk> technology and developed managerial skills ; third , it served as the core around which medium and small firms that supply and serve it grew . == influence == chandler 's work was somewhat ignored in history departments , but proved influential in business , economics , and <unk> the business field , chandler , along with kenneth r. andrews and igor <unk> , has been credited with the <unk> role in introducing and popularizing the concept of business <unk> sociology , prior to chandler 's research , some sociologists assumed there were no differences between governmental , corporate , and <unk> organizations . chandler 's focus on corporations clearly demonstrated that there were differences , and this thesis has influenced organizational sociologists ' work since the late <year>s . it also motivated sociologists to investigate and critique chandler 's work more closely , turning up instances in which chandler assumed american corporations acted for reasons of efficiency , when they actually operated in a context of politics or conflict . == see also == business history second industrial revolution james <unk> == bibliography == chandler , alfred d. `` the beginnings of <unk> business ' in american industry '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <unk> . chandler , alfred d. jr. , <unk> , strategy and structure : chapters in the history of the american industrial enterprise ( mit press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. ed . <year> , giant enterprise : ford , general motors , and the automobile industry . sources and readings ( <unk> , <unk> & world ) . chandler , alfred d. `` the <unk> : pioneers in modern corporate management '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <unk> in jstor chandler , alfred d. `` <unk> coal and the beginnings of the industrial revolution in the united states '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <unk> . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , the visible hand : the managerial revolution in american business ( the <unk> press of harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. and herman <unk> , eds . <year> , managerial <unk> : comparative perspectives on the rise of the modern industrial enterprise ( harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. `` the emergence of managerial capitalism '' business history review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <unk> . chandler , alfred d. jr. and richard s. <unk> , eds . <year> , the coming of managerial capitalism : a <unk> on the history of american economic institutions ( r. d. irwin ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , scale and scope : the dynamics of industrial capitalism ( the <unk> press of harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. `` what is a firm ? : a historical perspective '' european economic review <integer> # <integer> ( <year> ) : <unk> . chandler , alfred d. jr. and james w. <unk> , eds . <year> , a nation transformed by information : how information has shaped the united states from colonial times to the present ( oxford university press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , inventing the electronic century : the epic story of the consumer electronics and computer industries ( harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred d. jr. <year> , shaping the industrial century : the remarkable story of the evolution of the modern chemical and pharmaceutical industries ( harvard university press ) . chandler , alfred dupont jr. <year> , the essential alfred chandler : essays toward a historical theory of big business thomas k. <unk> , ed .

neurotransmitters are <unk> ( `` reuptake '' ) by the <unk> nerve ending , and <unk> for later <unk> . he theorized that epinephrine is held in tissues in an <unk> form and is liberated by the nervous system when needed . this research laid the groundwork for later selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( <unk> ) , such as <unk> , which block the reuptake of another neurotransmitter , serotonin .

'' her first job was for a trade magazine , as a secretary , then an editor . she sold articles to the <dayofweek> herald tribune , <unk> magazine , and <unk> studied at columbia university 's school of general studies for two years , taking courses in geology , zoology , law , political science , and economics . about the freedom to pursue study across her <unk> interests , she said : for the first time i liked school and for the first time i made good marks . this was almost my undoing because after i had garnered , <unk> , a certain number of credits i became the property of barnard college at columbia , and once i was the property of barnard i had to take , it seemed , what barnard wanted me to take , not what i wanted to learn . fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that barnard decided i could not belong to it and i was therefore allowed to continue getting an education . == career == after attending columbia university 's school of general studies for two years , butzner found a job at iron age magazine . her <year> article on economic decline in scranton was well publicized and led the murray corporation of america to <unk> a <unk> factory there . encouraged by this success , butzner <unk> the war production board to support more operations in scranton . experiencing job discrimination at iron age , she also advocated for equal pay for women and for the right of workers to <unk> . === america === she became a feature writer for the office of war information and then a reporter for amerika , a publication of the u.s. state department . while working there she met robert hyde jacobs jr. , a <unk> architect who was designing <unk> for grumman . they married in <year>. together they had a daughter , <unk> , and two sons , james and ned . they bought a <unk> building at <integer> hudson street . jane continued to write for america after the war , while robert left grumman and resumed work as an <unk> <unk> rejected the rapidly growing suburbs as `` <unk> '' , choosing to remain in greenwich village . they <unk> their house , in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area , and created a garden in the <unk> for the state department during the mccarthy era , jacobs received a <unk> about her political beliefs and loyalties . jacobs was anti-communist and had left the federal workers union because of its apparent communist <unk> . nevertheless , she was <unk> and <unk> , appreciated the writing of saul <unk> ; therefore she was under suspicion . on <integer> <month> <year> , jacobs delivered her response to conrad e. snow , chairman of the loyalty security board at the united states department of state . in her foreword to her answer , she said : the other threat to the security of our tradition , i believe , lies at home . it is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who <unk> them . i do not agree with the <unk> of either the left or the right , but i think they should be allowed to speak and to publish , both because they themselves have , and ought to have , rights , and once their rights are gone , the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ... === architectural forum === jacobs left amerika in <year> when it announced its <unk> to washington , d.c. she then found a <unk> job at architectural forum , published by henry <unk> of time inc. she was hired as an associate editor . after early success in that position , jacobs began to take assignments on urban planning and `` urban <unk> '' . in <year> , she was assigned to cover a development in philadelphia designed by edmund bacon . although her editors expected a positive story , jacobs criticized bacon 's project , reacting against its lack of concern for the poor african americans who were directly affected . when bacon showed jacobs examples of <unk> and developed blocks , she determined that `` development '' seemed to end community life on the street . when jacobs returned to the offices of architectural forum , she began to question the <year>s consensus on urban <unk> <year> , jacobs met william kirk , an <unk> minister who worked in east harlem . kirk came to the architectural forum offices to describe the impact that `` <unk> '' had on east harlem , and he introduced jacobs to the <unk> <year> , while standing in for douglas <unk> of architectural forum , jacobs delivered a lecture at harvard university . she addressed leading architects , urban planners , and intellectuals ( including lewis mumford ) , speaking on the topic of east harlem . she urged this audience to `` respect – in the <unk> sense – <unk> of chaos that have a <unk> wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order . '' contrary to her expectations , the talk was received with enthusiasm , but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners , real estate owners , and developers . architectural forum printed the speech that year , along with photographs of east harlem . === rockefeller foundation and death and life of great american cities === after reading her harvard speech , william h. whyte invited jacobs to write an article for fortune magazine . the resulting piece , `` downtown is for people '' , appeared in a <year> issue of fortune , and marked her first public criticism of robert moses . her criticism of the lincoln center was not popular with supporters of urban renewal at architectural forum and fortune . <unk> . jackson , the publisher of fortune , was outraged and over the telephone , demanded of whyte : `` who is this crazy dame ? '' the fortune article brought jacobs to the attention of <unk> gilpatric , then associate director of the humanities division at the rockefeller foundation . the foundation had moved <unk> into urban topics , with a recent award to the massachusetts institute of technology for studies of urban <unk> that would <unk> in the publication of kevin a. lynch 's image of the city . in <month> <year> , gilpatric invited jacobs to begin serving as a reviewer for grant proposals . later that year , the rockefeller foundation awarded a grant to jacobs to produce a critical study of city planning and urban life in the u.s. ( from the mid-1950s to the <unk> , the foundation 's humanities division sponsored an `` urban design studies '' research program , of which jacobs was the best known <unk> . ) gilpatric encouraged jacobs to `` <unk> [ e ] the field of urban design to look for ideas and actions which <month> improve thinking on how the design of cities might better serve urban life , including cultural and humane value . '' <unk> with the new school ( then called the new school for social research ) , she spent three years conducting research and writing <unk> . in <year> , random house published the result : the death and life of great american cities . the death and life of great american cities remains one of the most influential books in the history of american city planning . she coined the terms `` social capital '' , `` mixed primary uses '' , and `` eyes on the street '' , which were adopted <unk> in urban design , sociology , and many other fields . jacobs painted a <unk> picture of the profession of city planning , <unk> it a pseudoscience . this angered the <unk> urban planning profession . using ad <unk> attacks , jacobs was criticized as a `` militant dame '' and a `` housewife '' : an amateur who had no right to interfere with an established discipline . one planner dismissed jacobs ' book as `` bitter <unk> <unk> '' . robert moses , sent a copy , called it `` <unk> and also <unk> ... sell this <unk> to someone else . '' later , her book was criticized from the left for leaving out race and openly <unk> gentrification , which jacobs referred to as `` <unk> '' .in <year> , she resigned her position at architectural forum to become a full-time author and concentrate on raising her children . in other political activities she became an opponent of the vietnam war , <unk> on the pentagon in <month> <year> and criticized the construction of the world trade center as a disaster for manhattan 's <unk> . === struggle for greenwich village === during the <year>s and <year>s , her home neighborhood of greenwich village was being transformed by city and state efforts to build housing ( see , for example , jacobs ' <year> fight to build the west village houses in lieu of large apartment houses ) , private developers , the expansion of new york university , and by the urban renewal plans of robert moses . moses ' plan , funded as `` slum clearance '' by title i of the housing act of <year> , also called for several blocks to be <unk> and replaced with <unk> <unk> . the plan forced <integer> families out of their homes and <unk> <other>,000 small <unk> result was washington square village . as part of his efforts to <unk> the area , moses had proposed the extension of fifth avenue through washington square park in <year>. in the face of community opposition , moses had <unk> the project , but revived the idea in the <year>s . moses argued that the fifth avenue extension would improve the flow of traffic through the neighborhood and provide access to the planned lower manhattan expressway ( <unk> ) , which would <unk> the manhattan bridge and <unk> bridge with the holland <unk> response , local activist shirley hayes created the `` committee to save washington square park '' , a coalition of <unk> of local neighborhood groups that opposed the <unk> extension . raymond s. <unk> eventually took over the organization , changing its name to the `` joint emergency committee to close washington square to traffic '' . jacobs had joined the committee under hayes , but she took a more prominent role under <unk> , reaching out to media <unk> such as the village voice , which provided more sympathetic coverage than the new york times . the committee gained the support of margaret mead , eleanor roosevelt , lewis mumford , charles <unk> , and william h. whyte , as well as <unk> de <unk> , a greenwich village resident and influential democratic leader . de <unk> 's involvement proved decisive . on <integer> <month> <year> , the city closed washington square park to traffic , and the joint committee held a <unk> <unk> ( not cutting ) <unk> for <unk> expressway continued despite growing community opposition in areas such as little italy . in the <year>s , jacobs chaired the joint committee to stop the lower manhattan expressway . the new york times was sympathetic to moses , while the village voice covered community rallies and advocated against the expressway . jacobs continued to fight the expressway when plans <unk> in <year> , <year> , and <year> , and she became a local hero for her opposition to the project . she was arrested by a <unk> police officer on <month> <integer> , <year> , at a public hearing during which the crowd had charged the stage and destroyed the <unk> 's notes . she was accused of <unk> a <unk> , criminal <unk> , and <unk> public administration . after months of trials conducted in new york city ( to which jacobs <unk> from toronto ) , her charge was reduced to <unk> <unk> york : a documentary film devoted an hour of the <unk> , <unk> series to the battle between moses and jacobs . robert caro 's biography of moses , the power broker , gives only passing mention to this event , however , despite jacobs 's strong influence on caro . in <year> , caro told an interviewer about the difficulty in cutting more than <other>00,000 words from his initial manuscript : `` the section that i wrote on jane jacobs disappeared . to this day , when someone says : <unk> 's hardly a mention of jane jacobs , ' i think , <unk> i wrote a lot about her . ' every time i 'm asked about that , i have this sick feeling . '' == life in toronto == soon after her arrest in <year> , jacobs moved to toronto , eventually settling at <integer> albany avenue in the annex from <year> until her death in <year>. she decided to leave the u.s. in part because she opposed the vietnam war , she worried about the fate of her two <unk> sons , and she did not want to continue fighting the new york city government . she and her husband chose toronto because it was pleasant and offered employment opportunities , and they moved to an area of toronto that included so many americans avoiding the draft that it was called the `` american ghetto '' <unk> quickly became a leading figure in her new city and helped stop the proposed <unk> expressway . a frequent theme of her work was to ask whether cities were being built for people or for cars . she was arrested twice during demonstrations . she also had considerable influence on the regeneration of the st. lawrence neighborhood , a housing project regarded as a major success . she became a canadian citizen in <year> and later , she told writer james howard <unk> that dual citizenship was not possible at the time , implying that her u.s. citizenship was <unk> <year> , she offered a more urban perspective on quebec 's sovereignty in her book , the question of separatism : quebec and the struggle over separation . jacobs was an advocate of a province of toronto to separate the city proper from ontario . jacobs said , `` cities , to <unk> in the twenty-first century , must separate themselves politically from their surrounding areas . `` she was selected to be an officer of the order of canada in <year> for her seminal writings and <unk> <unk> on urban development . the community and urban sociology section of the american sociological association awarded her its outstanding lifetime contribution award in <year>. in <year> , the city government of toronto sponsored a conference entitled , `` jane jacobs : ideas that matter '' , which led to a book by the same name . at the end of the conference , the jane jacobs prize was created . it includes an annual <unk> of $ <other>,000 for three years to be given to `` celebrate toronto 's original , <unk> heroes – by seeking out citizens who are engaged in activities that contribute to the city 's <unk> '' . jacobs never <unk> away from expressing her political support for specific candidates . she opposed the <year> <unk> of the cities of <unk> toronto , fearing that individual neighborhoods would have less power with the new structure . she backed an ecologist , <unk> <unk> , who lost toronto 's <year> <unk> race , and she was an adviser to david miller 's successful <month>oral campaign in <year> , at a time when he was seen as a <unk> . during the <month>oral campaign , jacobs helped lobby against the construction of a bridge to join the city <unk> to toronto city centre airport ( <unk> ) . following the election , the toronto city council 's earlier decision to approve the bridge was reversed and bridge construction project was stopped . <unk> did <unk> the ferry service and the airport was still in operation as of <year>. in lieu of the bridge , a <unk> <unk> broke ground in <month> <year>. the <unk> opened on <integer> <month> <year> . jacobs also was active in a campaign against a plan of royal st. george 's college ( an established school very close to the jacobs residence in toronto 's annex district ) to <unk> its facilities . jacobs suggested not only that the <unk> be stopped but that the school be forced from the neighborhood entirely . although toronto council initially rejected the school 's plans , the decision later was reversed – and the project was given the <unk> by the ontario municipal board ( <unk> ) when opponents failed to produce credible witnesses and tried to withdraw from the case during the <unk> also had an influence on vancouver 's urban planning . jacobs has been called `` the mother of <unk> '' , referring to that city 's use of her `` density done well '' <unk> died in toronto western hospital aged <integer> , on <integer> <month> <year> , apparently , of a stroke . she was survived by a brother , james butzner ( d. <year> ) ; a daughter , <unk> jacobs , her sons , james and ned of vancouver , and by two grandchildren and two <unk> . upon her death her family 's statement noted : `` what 's important is not that she died but that she lived , and that her life 's work has greatly influenced the way we think . <unk> remember her by reading her books and implementing her ideas '' . == legacy == jacobs is credited , along with lewis mumford , with inspiring the new urbanist movement . she has been characterized as a major influence on <unk> and radical <unk> thought . she discussed her legacy in an interview with reason magazine . reason : what do you think you 'll be remembered for most ? you were the one who stood up to the federal <unk> and the urban renewal people and said they were destroying the <unk> of these cities . is that what it will be ? jacobs : no . if i were to be remembered as a really important thinker of the century , the most important thing i 've contributed is my discussion of what makes economic expansion happen . this is something that has puzzled people always . i think i 've <unk> out what it is . expansion and development are two different things . development is differentiation of what already existed . practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing , from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes . expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity . that is a different thing . i 've gone at it two different ways . way back when i wrote the economy of cities , i wrote about import replacing and how that <unk> , not just the economy of the place where it occurs , but economic life altogether . as a city <unk> imports , it shifts its imports . it does n't import less . and yet it has everything it had before . reason : it 's not a <unk> game . it 's a <unk> , growing <unk> . jacobs : that 's the actual mechanism of it . the theory of it is what i explain in the nature of economies . i <unk> it to what happens with biomass , the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area . the energy , the material that 's involved in this , does n't just escape the community as an export . it continues being used in a community , just as in a rainforest the waste from certain organisms and various plants and animals gets used by other ones in the place . while jacobs saw her greatest legacy to be her contributions to economic theory , it is in the realm of urban planning that she has had her most extensive effect . her observations about the ways in which cities function <unk> the urban planning profession and <unk> many accepted planning models that had dominated <unk> planning . the influential harvard economist edward <unk> , known for his work on urban studies , acknowledged that jane jacobs ( <year>s ) had been <unk> in attacking moses for `` replacing <unk> neighborhoods with le <unk> <unk> '' . <unk> agreed that these housing projects proved to be moses ' greatest failures , `` moses spent millions and <unk> tens of thousands to create buildings that became centers of crime , poverty , and <unk> . `` she also was famous for introducing concepts such as the `` <unk> of the sidewalk '' and `` eyes on the street '' , a reference to what would later be known as natural surveillance . the concept had a huge influence on planners and architects such as <unk> newman , who prepared the idea through a series of studies that would <unk> in his <unk> space theory . the work of jacobs and newman would go on to affect american housing policy through the hope vi program , an effort by the united states department of housing and urban development to <unk> the high-rise public housing projects so <unk> by jacobs and to replace them with <unk> , <unk> housing . throughout her life , jacobs fought to alter the way in which city development was approached . by arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems , she advocated ideas such as `` mixed use '' development and bottom-up planning . furthermore , her harsh criticisms of `` slum clearing '' and `` high-rise housing '' projects were instrumental in discrediting these once universally supported planning <unk> is remembered as being an advocate for the <unk> development of cities , and for leaving `` a legacy of <unk> for citizens to trust their common sense and become advocates for their place '' <unk> the fact that jacobs mainly focused on new york city , her arguments have been identified as universal . for instance , her opposition against the <unk> of urban

projects of the housing commission of victoria , which they argued had little regard for the impact on local <unk> fought an <unk> battle against dominant trends of planning . despite the united states remaining very much a suburban nation , the work of jacobs has contributed to city living being <unk> and <unk> . because of her ideas , today , many <unk> urban neighborhoods are more likely to be <unk> than cleared for <unk> . it <month> be that we have become so <unk> as a people that we no longer care how things do work , but only what kind of quick , easy outer impression they give . if so , there is little hope for our cities or probably for much else in our society . but i do not think this is so . in her book <unk> and life of great american cities , ' written in <year> , <unk> jacobs 's enormous achievement was to <unk> her own <unk> critique of <days>-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities . at a time when both common and inspired

documentary film citizen jane : battle for the city , which depicts her <unk> over robert moses and her philosophy of urban design . == in popular culture == a fictionalized version of her is played by alison smith in a season <integer> episode of the amazon series the <unk> mrs. <unk> . the community <unk> played by <unk> jones in <unk> brooklyn has drawn comparisons to jane jacobs . the director , edward norton , has <unk> that the composite character was partially based on jacobs , but more so on <unk> <unk> who was active a decade earlier . the url of the <unk> group new urbanist <unk> for <unk> teens ( <unk> ) is <unk> . == criticism == the planners and developers she fought against to preserve the west village were among those who initially criticized her ideas . robert moses has generally been identified as her <unk> during this period . since then , jacobs ' ideas have been analysed many times , often in regard to the outcomes that their influences have <unk> places such as the west village , the factors that she argued would maintain economic and cultural diversity have led instead to gentrification and some of the most expensive real estate in the world . her family 's conversion of an old candy shop into a home is an example of the <unk> trend that would continue under the influence of jacobs 's <unk> also was caused , however , by `` the completely unexpected influx of affluent residents back into the inner city '' . the extent to which her ideas <unk> this phenomenon was at the time <unk> . for example , she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people . in this respect , she saw them as `` <unk> of social diversity '' . that many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was <unk> in <year>. issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of jane jacobs ' planning <unk> <unk> <unk> has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure , and suggests that economists <unk> with some of her approaches to development . for example , although her ideas of planning were praised at times as `` universal '' , they are now thought <unk> when a city <unk> from one million to ten million ( as has happened many times in developing nations ) . such arguments suggest that her ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of new york , where jacobs developed many of them . == works == jane jacobs spent her life studying cities . her books include : === the death and life of great american cities === the death and life of great american cities is her <unk> influential book and , possibly , the most influential book on urban planning and cities . published in <year> , this book was widely read by both planning professionals and the general public . the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the <year>s , which , she claimed , destroyed communities and created isolated , <unk> urban spaces . in the book , she <unk> the diversity and complexity of <unk> use neighborhoods while <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of modern planning . jacobs advocated the abolition of <unk> laws and restoration of free markets in land , which would result in dense , <unk> neighborhoods and she frequently cited new york city 's greenwich village as an example of a <unk> urban community . robert caro has cited it as the strongest influence on the power broker , his <unk> biography of robert moses , although caro does not mention jacobs by name in the book despite jacobs ' battles with moses over his proposed lower manhattan expressway . caro reportedly cut a chapter about jacobs due to his book 's <unk> the practical lessons in city design and planning that death and life offers , the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development <unk> . jane jacobs <unk> her positions with common sense and <unk> . === the economy of cities === the thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development . her main argument is that <unk> economic growth <unk> from urban import replacement . import replacement is the process of producing goods <unk> that formerly were imported , e.g. , tokyo bicycle factories replacing tokyo bicycle <unk> in the <year>s . jacobs claims that import replacement <unk> up local infrastructure , skills , and production . jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently <unk> to other cities , giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement , thus producing a positive cycle of growth . in an interview with bill <unk> in reason magazine , jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning , but for the discovery of import replacement . critics erroneously claim that her ideas <unk> the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as andre gunder frank . import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation <unk> its imports with national production , the nation would become <unk> , whereas jacob 's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution . however , even this would lead to confusion since in practice , import substitution in india and latin america were government <unk> and <unk> , whereas jacobs ' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a <unk> the second part of the book , jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture . she argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture ; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition . another interpretation of history , generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to jacobs ' is supported by marxist archaeologist <unk> gordon childe and in recent times , by another historical <unk> charles keith maisels these writers argue that agriculture preceded cities . the apparent opposition between childe and jacobs theories rests in their definition of <unk> ' , <unk> ' , or <unk> ' . childe , like other <unk> such as maisels or henri <unk> defines <unk> ' or <unk> ' as <unk> a <unk> , socially <unk> , <unk> political community , whereas , as one can see from the economy of cities or from cities and the wealth of nations , jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of <unk> dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor . without the requirements of literacy , <unk> building , or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces , <unk> ' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when childe and maisels place them . however , the jacobs definition is <unk> , since <unk> ' is defined simply as a large town or `` a large human settlement '' indicating <unk> . the earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than that they were <unk> as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement , implying nomadic <unk> until further discoveries are found . === the question of separatism : quebec and the struggle over sovereignty === the question of separatism incorporated and expanded jacobs ' presentation of the <year> massey lectures , entitled canadian cities and <unk> . it was published in <year> and reprinted in <year> with a <unk> <year> interview with robin <unk> on the subject in which she <unk> the relative <unk> of that book among her usual readership . this was the first time jacobs was requested to discuss it in an interview . <unk> richard <unk> advanced that while not openly criticizing her , english-speaking <unk> readers thought she did not understood how canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity ( the <year> referendum was just defeated by a vote of <integer> % ) . the question of separatism was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her <year> obituary in the globe and <unk> ' book advances the view that quebec 's eventual independence is best for montreal , toronto , the rest of canada , and the world ; and that such independence can be achieved <unk> . as precedent , she <unk> norway 's secession from sweden and how it <unk> both nations . the origins of the contemporary <unk> in the quiet revolution are examined , along with canada 's historical reliance on natural resources and <unk> manufacturing for its own economic development . jacobs <unk> that such an approach is colonial and hence backward , citing by example , canada buying its <unk> and furniture from norway or <unk> factories in canada , the latter procedure being a product of canadian tariffs designed specifically to foster such factories . the relevant public views of rené lévesque , <unk> ryan , and then prime minister pierre trudeau are also critically analyzed , an example being their failure to recognize that two respective , independent <unk> are essential to the success of an independent quebec and a smaller resultant canada , an issue that is central to her book . jacobs <unk> the need for montreal to continue developing its leadership of québécois culture , but that ultimately , such a need can never be fulfilled by montreal 's increasing tendencies toward <unk> status , tendencies <unk> economic , political , and cultural <unk> to english-speaking toronto . such an outcome , jacobs believed , would in the long run doom quebec 's independence as much as it would hinder canada 's own future . she concludes with her observation that the popular <unk> of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the enlightenment , which perceived nature as a force for `` <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . '' since then , naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity , and that , `` diversity itself is of the essence of excellence . '' the right kind of secession , jacobs states , can lead to the right kind of diversity , and quebec and canada are capable of both , and must achieve both , to survive . === cities and the wealth of nations === cities and the wealth of nations attempts to do for economics what the death and life of great american cities did for modern urban planning , although it has not received the same critical attention . beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics , this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists . classical ( and <unk> ) economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in macroeconomics . jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state , rather it is the city that is the true player in this worldwide game . she <unk> the idea of import replacement from her earlier book the economy of cities , while <unk> on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second , or not at all . === systems of survival === systems of survival : a dialogue on the moral foundations of commerce and politics moves outside of the city , studying the moral underpinnings of work . as with her other work , she used an <unk> approach . this book is written as a <unk> dialogue . it appears that she ( as described by characters in her book ) took newspaper clippings of moral <unk> related to work , collected and <unk> them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behavior that were mutually exclusive . she calls these two patterns `` moral syndrome a '' , or commercial moral syndrome , and `` moral syndrome b '' , or guardian moral syndrome . she claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners , scientists , farmers , and traders . similarly , she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government , <unk> , <unk> , and religious institutions . she also claims that these moral syndromes are fixed , and do not <unk> over time . it is important to stress that jane jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work , and not all moral ideas . moral ideas that are not included in her system are applicable to both syndromes . jane jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed , showing the work underpinnings of the mafia and communism , and what happens when new york <unk> police are paid <unk> here – <unk> slightly as a part of the larger analysis . === the nature of economies === the nature of economies , a <unk> between friends concerning the premise : `` human beings exist <unk> within nature as part of the natural order in every respect '' ( p. ix ) , argues that the same principles <unk> both ecosystems and economies : `` development and <unk> through differentiation and their combinations ; expansion through diverse , multiple uses of energy ; and <unk> through <unk> '' ( p. <integer> ) . jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems . jacobs ' characters discuss the four methods by which `` <unk> stable systems '' <month> evade collapse : `` <unk> ; <unk> loops ; <unk> controls ; and emergency adaptations '' ( p. <integer> ) . their conversations also cover the `` double nature of fitness for survival '' ( traits to avoid destroying one 's own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed , p. <integer> ) , and <unk> including the butterfly effect characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as <unk> response to cause , and self-organization where `` a system can be making itself up as it goes along '' ( p. <integer> ) . the book is <unk> with many real-world economic and biological examples , which help keep the book `` down to earth '' and <unk> , if dense . concepts are <unk> with both economic and biological examples , showing their <unk> in both <unk> . one particularly interesting insight is the creation of `` something from nothing '' – an economy from nowhere . in the biological world , free energy is given through <unk> , but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy , or at least <unk> energy . another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies , for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system : this can lead to the creation of `` new species of work '' . === dark age ahead === published in <year> by random house , dark age ahead posits jacobs ' argument that `` north american '' civilization shows signs of a spiral decline comparable to the collapse of the roman empire . her discussion focuses on `` five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm '' , which can be summarized as the nuclear family and community ; quality in education ; free thought in science ; <unk> government and responsible taxes ; and corporate and professional <unk> . as the title of this book suggests , jacobs ' outlook is far more <unk> than that of her previous works . however , in the conclusion she <unk> : `` at a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the <unk> . is suburban <unk> , with its murders of communities and <unk> of land , time , and energy , a sign of decay ? or is rising interest in means of overcoming <unk> a sign of <unk> and <unk> in north american culture ? arguably , either could turn out to be true . '' while jacobs idealized u.s. democracy , dark age ahead echoes the skepticism and disappointment that led to her <unk> to canada in <year>. later , she would indicate that north american cultures , among others , were grounded in a `` plantation <unk> '' that was culturally and <unk> <unk> . == orthodox urbanism == jane jacobs <unk> in her work , the death and life of great american cities , that the sources of orthodox urbanism are : garden cities of tomorrow , <unk> howard the culture of cities , lewis mumford cities in evolution , sir patrick <unk> modern housing , catherine bauer toward new towns for america , clarence stein nothing gained by <unk> , sir raymond unwin the city of tomorrow and its planning , le <unk> == writings == constitutional <unk> ; rejected <unk> of the constitutional convention of <year> , with <unk> argument compiled by jane butzner , ( <year> ) columbia university press ; compiled by jane jacobs ( née butzner ) , reprinted <year> by <unk> press , port washington , new york . isbn <unk> the death and life of great american cities ( <year> ) new york : random house . isbn <unk> the economy of cities ( <year> ) isbn <unk> the question of separatism : quebec and the struggle over sovereignty ( <year> random house and <year> <unk> books ) isbn <unk> cities and the wealth of nations ( <year> ) isbn <unk> the girl on the <unk> ( children 's book illustrated by karen <unk> ) , ( <month> <year> ) oxford university press . isbn <unk> systems of survival : a dialogue on the moral foundations of commerce and politics ( <year> ) isbn <unk> a schoolteacher in old alaska – the story of <unk> <unk> ( <year> ) random house of canada . isbn <unk> the nature of economies ( <year> ) new york : random house , the modern library . isbn <unk> dark age ahead ( <year> ) isbn <unk> vital little plans : the short works of jane jacobs ( <year> ) new york : random house . isbn <unk> == see also == david <unk> fred <unk> innovation economics urban secession == references == === bibliography === <unk> , alice <unk> ( <year> ) . jane jacobs : urban visionary . new brunswick : rutgers . isbn <unk> . allen , max , ed .

ministers , the only woman ever to hold this post . between <year> and <year> , she served as president of the east german national bank . == life == === <unk> and early years === margarete wittkowski was born in posen . her father was a businessman : her mother was a pianist . she attended school in posen till <year> , when the family moved to berlin . here , between <year> and <year> , she studied social economics ( `` <unk> '' ) . till <year> she was active in the <unk> movement , after which , following `` discussions with leftist friends '' her political energies were increasingly focused on the communist party , which she joined in <month> <year> . === nazi germany , swiss exile ( <year>-1939 ) === in <month> <year> the political <unk> was transformed when the nazi party took power and converted germany into a one-party dictatorship . political activity - except in support of the nazi party - became illegal . at the end of <month> the <unk> fire was <unk> blamed on the communists , and in <month> <year> those identified as communists began to be arrested . during <year> margarete wittkowski emigrated to switzerland , where she enrolled at basel university and worked on her doctorate dissertation . she passed the oral element of her doctoral exam , for which she was supervised by edgar <unk> and herman <unk> , in <month> <year> , for work concerning the relationships between the big banks in berlin and german industry . some sources indicate that she received her doctorate in <unk> applied to the <unk> foundation for a research <unk> , but was unable to provide the necessary <unk> information to support a successful application . she was nevertheless able to pursue an academic career , working with jürgen kuczynski , a distinguished economist and , like her , a refugee from nazi germany . the focus of their work was a study entitled `` die <unk> der <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> '' ( `` the economics of <unk> : hitler 's new economic order in europe '' ) , which in the end was published in <year> , and concerned the economic policy of the fascist states . the authors attacked the widespread contention that the economy in nazi germany was unusually efficient . it was their view that labour output was lower and the accident rate was higher than before <year> , and that earnings growth since then was <unk> to monopoly practices , reduced raw material costs , a reduction in emphasis on consumer goods and an extension of working hours . there was also a warning directed at the united states ( at this stage still not militarily involved against germany ) that successful conquest by nazi germany of europe and the soviet union would give rise to a fascist european bloc capable of <unk> the world with cheap manufactured <unk> , between <year> and <year> , wittkowski continued to travel to germany , while taking care to <unk> back to switzerland when the situation appeared to be becoming too dangerous . in the spring of <year> she moved to berlin where she co-produced a communist trades union newspaper with a like <unk> comrade called <unk> <unk> . early the next year she narrowly escaped arrest , <unk> again to switzerland in <month> <year>. she worked on several newspapers for distribution to southern germany , including an illegal newspaper aimed at farming communities . other newspapers for which she wrote include the `` <unk> <unk> '' and `` <unk> <unk> '' . she was also involved in distribution , according to one source making `` frequent trips to `` the southern <unk> border area where she <unk> over illegal publications and messages '' . there are references to her having at times undertaken her courier activities under the cover name `` <unk> '' . there was also at least one visit to paris , in <month> <year> , which at this time had become the de facto headquarters of the germany communist party in exile . === british exile ( <unk> ) === in <month> <year> , a few days after the `` <unk> '' <unk> across the border , wittkowski was arrested in zürich and expelled from the country for her `` illegal political activities '' . she lived - now illegally - in basel for another six months , after which , in <month> <year> , she succeeded in <unk> to england , where her literary collaborator jürgen kuczynski had been based since <year>. sources are largely silent over her activities in england during the war years . unlike many political refugees from nazi germany , there is no record of her having been interned as an enemy alien by the english when war broke out , which <month> well reflect her work with kuczynski who had excellent connections with elements of the british establishment . it is on record that until <year> she worked for the <unk> with harry <unk> , a leading member of the communist party . she appears to have been considered a leader among the exiled german communists in england . === soviet occupation zone ( <unk> ) === margarete wittkowski returned to berlin in <month> <year>. the region surrounding the city was now administered as the soviet occupation zone , although the contentious creation of the socialist unity party ( `` sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands '' / sed ) a couple of months earlier had already created a necessary <unk> for its <unk> in <month> <year> as a new kind of one-party dictatorship , the german democratic republic ( east germany ) . wittkowski joined the sed in <year>. jürgen kuczynski was already back in town , and together they founded a weekly newspaper called `` die wirtschaft '' ( `` the economy '' ) . she also took charge of the economics section of <unk> <unk> , the newly established <unk> daily newspaper of the recently established socialist unity party . sources nevertheless indicate that wittkowski objected to being given work as a journalist because she wished to contribute more directly to rebuilding the <unk> <year> or <year> she joined the german economic commission established by the occupation forces . working closely with bruno <unk> , this involved a central role in devising the planned economic model for the new socialist german state . in <unk> she attended a course at the party academy . there was a study period in moscow . in <unk> she served as vice president on the german economic commission for what had become , in <month> <year> , the german democratic republic ( east germany ) . === german democratic republic ( <year>-1974 ) === in <year> wittkowski was transferred to the consumer <unk> association , an office she held till <year>. this was a demotion , attributed by one source to an <unk> by walter ulbricht of stalin 's <year> <unk> of `` <unk> conspirators '' . others , referring to her time in england , are content to point out that during this time `` those who had emigrated to the west were more likely to be considered as unreliable comrades '' . whatever the reason for her removal from the german economic commission , it does appear that wittkowski was respected for her formidable intellect , which unlike others she was sometimes willing to <unk> in discussions involving walter ulbricht , the country 's <unk> stalin died , in <month> <year> , the east german party leadership became slightly less nervous , and in <year> she was reinstated as deputy president of what had now become the state planning commission , which gave her significant influence over national economic policy . in <month> <year> wittkowski was also elected a member of the powerful party central committee , which under the <unk> power structure employed in east germany was the real focus of political power . she also sat as a member of the national parliament ( `` volkskammer '' ) between <year> and <year> , and again between <year> and <unk> <year> and <year> , wittkowski found herself increasingly out of line with the leadership , both because of differences over aspects of economic policy and because she sought to open a spirit of wider debate . in a speech delivered on <integer> <month> <year> to the central committee plenum she criticised ulbricht over his failure to brief central committee members on the <unk> events at the soviet <days> party congress in moscow the previous month : she urged a little more openness within the east german central committee . wittkowski advocated greater priority be given to <unk> and the needs of the population . at the central committee plenum in <month> <year> she called for greater decentralisation of economic decision making . addressing the central committee plenum in <month> <year> , she criticised the `` bureaucratic '' actions of many functionaries , which she characterised as discrediting the `` party and the government '' . she also appealed for a less <unk> policy with socialists in the german federal republic , where a court imposed ban on the communist party in <month> <year> failed to <unk> significant protests by west german workers . there were two german states but there was only one german working class . wittkowski might have taken a lead within the central committee in <unk> aspects of economic policy , but she was not a <unk> voice . inside the central committee , karl <unk> and ernst <unk> were <unk> similar sentiments . other prominent critics of the party line were <unk> <unk> , fred <unk> and fritz <unk> , whereas wittkowski saw in the social democratic party ( spd ) in west germany a potential ally in support of workers and in opposition to the adenauer <unk> , ulbricht saw the western spd , even before publication in <year> of the <unk> program , as <unk> <unk> . the idea that one might `` do business '' with them was a <unk> of valued stalinist <unk> . more generally , he was <unk> by her economic and other criticisms . her advocacy of `` socialist <unk> '' led to a charge of `` <unk> '' . in <month> <year> the central committee plenum endorsed the orthodox line advocated by general secretary ulbricht : wittkowski underwent a `` temporary demotion '' . ( for the other critics named in the previous <unk> demotion was permanent ) she was removed from her deputy presidency of the state planning commission and her name was no longer included on the party list for the volkskammer election that year . she was also resigned from the central committee , although her name now appeared on the list of candidates for central committee membership , an <unk> not afforded to comrades <unk> and <unk> was quickly restored to the state planning commission <unk> , although now there was more than one vice-president so that her relative stature within the body was diminished . a few years later , after <year> , the economic reforms <unk> as the `` new economic system '' , reflecting a modest <unk> of centralised control across the entire `` eastern bloc '' seemed to acknowledge concerns that had been expressed by wittkowski three years before . she herself remained at this point outside the party central committee politburo , but her principal <unk> within it was werner <unk> who had been a pupil of her old friend and literary collaborator , jürgen kuczynski . in <month> <year> she resigned from the state planning commission for the last time and took up a post as a deputy chair of the council of ministers , where her <unk> responsibilities covered trade , supply , and agriculture . over the years there were many deputy <unk> of the council of ministers , but wittkowski was the only woman ever to be numbered among them . she held this post till <month> <year>. meanwhile , in <year> she was <unk> to the party central <unk> wittkowski 's final big job , to which she was appointed in <year> , was the presidency of what was renamed , on <integer> <month> <year> , the east german central bank ( <unk> ) . she held this position until her death , which took place while she was travelling , at <unk> on the <unk> edge of west germany . == references == < end_of_passage > < start_of_passage > thomas michael clegg (

radio astronomy , which combined his interests in amateur radio and amateur astronomy . he was instrumental in investigating and extending karl jansky 's pioneering work , and conducted the first sky survey in the radio <unk> <year> radio antenna was the second ever to be used for astronomical purposes and the first <unk> reflecting antenna to be used as a radio telescope . for nearly a decade he was the world 's only radio astronomer . == life == reber was born and raised in wheaton , illinois , a suburb of chicago , and graduated from <unk> institute of technology ( now illinois institute of technology ) in <year> with a degree in electrical engineering . he was an amateur radio operator , and worked for various radio manufacturers in chicago from <year> to <year> . when he learned of karl jansky 's work in <year> , he decided this was the field he wanted to work in , and applied to bell labs , where jansky was working . however , this was during the height of the great depression and there were no jobs available . === early experimentation === in the summer of <year> , reber decided to build his own radio telescope in his back yard in wheaton , il . reber 's radio telescope was considerably more advanced than jansky 's , and consisted of a <unk> sheet metal dish <integer> meters in <unk> , focusing to a radio receiver <integer> meters above the dish . the entire assembly was mounted on a <unk> stand , allowing it to be pointed in various directions , though not turned . the telescope was completed in <month> <unk> 's first receiver operated at <integer> mhz and failed to <unk> signals from outer space , as did his second , operating at <integer> mhz . finally , his third attempt , at <integer> mhz , was successful in <year> , <unk> jansky 's discovery . in <year> , he achieved his first professional publication , in the astrophysical journal , but reber refused a research appointment with yerkes observatory . he turned his attention to making a <unk> sky map , which he completed in <year> and extended in <year>. he published a considerable body of work during this era , and was the initiator of the `` <unk> '' of radio astronomy in the immediate <unk> world war era . his data , published as <unk> <unk> showing the <unk> of the sky in radio <unk> , revealed the existence of radio sources such as <unk> a and <unk> a for the first time . for nearly a decade from <year> on he was the world 's only radio astronomer , a field that only expanded after world war two when scientists , who had gained a great deal of knowledge during the wartime expansion of radar , entered the field , starting with project diana . during this time he uncovered a mystery that was not explained until the <year>s . the standard theory of radio <unk> from space was that they were due to <unk> radiation , light ( of which radio is a <unk> form ) that is given off by all hot bodies . using this theory one would expect that there would be considerably more <unk> light than <unk> , due to the presence of stars and other hot bodies . however reber demonstrated that the reverse was true , and that there was a considerable amount of <unk> radio signal . it was not until the <year>s that <unk> radiation was offered as an explanation for these measurements . reber sold his telescope to the national bureau of standards , and it was erected on a <unk> at their field station in sterling , virginia . eventually the telescope made its way to the national radio astronomy observatory in green bank , west virginia , and reber supervised its reconstruction at that site . reber also helped with a reconstruction of jansky 's original telescope . === medium frequency research === starting in <year> , he received generous support from the research corporation in new york , and moved to hawaii . in the <year>s , he wanted to return to active studies but much of the field was already filled with very large and expensive instruments . instead he turned to a field that was being largely ignored , that of medium frequency ( <unk> ) radio signals in the <unk> mhz range , around the am broadcast <unk> . however , signals with <unk> below <integer> mhz are reflected by an <unk> <unk> in the earth 's atmosphere called the ionosphere . in <year> , reber moved to tasmania , the <unk> state of australia , where he worked with bill ellis at the university of tasmania . there , on very cold , long , winter <unk> the ionosphere would , after many hours <unk> from the sun 's radiation by the bulk of the earth , <unk> ' and <unk> , allowing the longer radio waves into his antenna array . reber described this as being a `` <unk> situation '' . tasmania also offered low levels of <unk> radio noise , which permitted reception of the <unk> signals from outer space . in the <year>s , he had an array of <unk> set up on the sheep <unk> property of <unk> , about <decimal> km northeast of the town of <unk> , tasmania , where he lived in a house of his own design and construction he decided to build after he purchased a job lot of coach <unk> at a local auction . he imported <unk> douglas <unk> beams directly from a sawmill in oregon , and then high technology double <unk> window <unk> , also from the us . the <unk> held the house together . the window <unk> formed a north facing passive solar wall , <unk> <unk> black painted , <unk> copper sheets , from which the <unk> air rose by <unk> . the interior <unk> were <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . the house was so well <unk> insulated that the <unk> in the <unk> was nearly <unk> because the heat from it , unable to escape , would raise the temperature of the room to over <integer> °c ( <integer> <unk> ) . === final years === his house was never completely finished . it was meant to have a passive heat storage device , in the form of a <unk> insulated <unk> full of <unk> rocks , <unk> , but although his mind was sharp , his body started to fail him in his later years , and he was never able to move the rocks . he was fascinated by <unk> and had at least one in every room . he had one of the <unk> from the prime focus of his first telescope , probably the one used at <integer> mhz . it was of compact <unk> construction and used two <unk> . type <integer> `` <unk> '' <unk> <unk> . all the <unk> wires in it had <unk> and the rubber was hard and <unk> . he <unk> this <unk> , and all his later <unk> at <unk> , from <unk> , to avoid interference entering the equipment along power <unk> . reber was not a believer of the big bang theory ; he believed that red shift was due to repeated <unk> and <unk> or interaction of light and other <unk> <unk> by low density dark matter , over <unk> distances , and he published an article called `` <unk> , <unk> , stable universe '' , which outlined his theory . reber was supportive of the tired light explanation for the <unk> <unk> was looked after in his final days at the <unk> district hospital , about <integer> km northwest of hobart , tasmania , where he died in <year> , two days before his <days> birthday . his ashes are located at <unk> cemetery , just past new norfolk in tasmania and at many major radio <unk> around the

began working as a research associate and joined the cowles commission at the university of chicago in the summer of <year>. he remained there for five years , returning to paris periodically . in <year> , he published a breakthrough paper , entitled existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy , together with kenneth arrow , in which they provided a definitive mathematical proof of the existence of a general equilibrium , using topological rather than <unk> methods . in <year> , he moved to yale university . in <year> , he published his classical monograph , theory of value : an axiomatic analysis of economic equilibrium ( cowles foundation monographs series ) , which is one of the most important works in mathematical economics . he also studied several problems in the theory of cardinal utility , in particular the <unk> <unk> of a utility function defined on a <unk> product of sets . in this monograph , debreu set up an axiomatic foundation for competitive markets . he also established the existence of an equilibrium using a novel approach . the main idea of his argument is to show that there exists a price system for which the aggregate excess demand correspondence <unk> . he did so by proving a type of <unk> theorem that is based on the <unk> <unk> theorem . in chapter <integer> , debreu introduced the concept of uncertainty and showed how it could be incorporated into the <unk> model . here , he introduced the notion of a contingent <unk> , which is a promise to deliver a good should a certain state of nature be realized . this concept is very frequently used in financial economics , where it is known as the `` <unk> security '' . in <year>–61 , he worked at the center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences at stanford and devoted most of his time to the complex proof that appeared in <year> of a general theorem on the existence of an economic equilibrium . in <month> <year> , he started working at the university of california , berkeley , where he held the titles of university professor and class of <year> professor of economics and mathematics emeritus . during his <unk> in the late <year>s and <year>s , he visited universities in <unk> , cambridge , bonn and paris . in <year> , he visited the university of canterbury as an <unk> fellow , lecturing in economic <unk> later studies <unk> mainly on the theory of differentiable economies , where he showed that , in general , aggregate excess demand functions <unk> at a finite number of points – basically , he showed that economies have a finite number of price equilibria . in <year> , he received the french legion of honour . he was awarded the <year> bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel , for having incorporated new analytical methods into economic theory and for his rigorous reformulation of general equilibrium theory . he was a member of the international academy of science . in <year> , he served as president

jackson , john weakland , jay haley ) responsible for introducing what became known as the `` double bind '' theory of schizophrenia . double bind can be defined as a person trapped under mutually exclusive expectations . watzlawick 's <year> work based on bateson 's thinking , pragmatics of human communication ( with don jackson and janet beavin ) , became a <unk> work of communication theory . other scientific contributions include works on radical constructivism and most importantly his theory on communication . he was active in the field of family therapy . watzlawick was one of the

research on how communication is <unk> within families . watzlawick defines five basic axioms in his theory on communication , popularly known as the `` interactional view '' . the interactional view is an <unk> theory drawing from the cybernetic tradition . the five axioms are necessary in order to have a functioning communication process and competence between two individuals or an entire family . when it comes to this theory , <unk> happens because all of the communicators are not `` speaking the same language '' . this happens because people have different viewpoints of speaking . its principles are cybernetic , its causality is of a circular , feedback nature , and , with information being its core element , it is concerned with the processes of communication within systems of the <unk> <unk> therefore also with human systems , e.g. , families , large organizations and even international relations . the communication within the `` interactional view '' is based on what is happening , and not necessarily associated with who , when , where , or why it takes place . `` normal '' as well as the `` disturbed '' family is studied in order to <unk> conditions <unk> to the approach of <unk> . it is believed that individual personality , character , and <unk> are shaped by the individual 's relations with his fellows . thus , symptoms , <unk> , character structure and personality can be seen as terms describing the individual 's typical interactions which occur in response to a particular <unk> context . the whole is more than the sum of its parts , and it is that whole in which we are interested . === five basic axioms === the interactional view requires a network of communication rules that govern a family homeostasis , which is the <unk> <unk> of family members to maintain the status quo . even if the status quo is negative it can still be hard to change . interactional theorists believe that we will fail to recognize this destructive resistance to change unless we understand watzlawick 's axioms . the following axioms can explain how <unk> can occur if all the communicators are not on the same page . if one of these axioms is somehow disturbed , communication might fail . all of these axioms are derived from the work of gregory bateson , much of which is collected in steps to an ecology of mind ( <year> ) <unk> , beavin <unk> and jackson support these axioms to maintain family homeostasis . one can not not communicate : every behavior is a form of communication . because behavior does not have a counterpart ( there is no <unk> ) , it is impossible not to communicate . even if communication is being avoided ( such as the <unk> use of <unk> or symptom strategy ) , that is a form of communication . `` symptom strategy '' is <unk> our silence to something beyond our control and makes no communication impossible . examples of symptom strategy are <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . even <unk> expressions , digital communication , and being silent can be analyzed as communication by a receiver . every communication has a content and relationship aspect such that the latter <unk> the former and is therefore a metacommunication : all communication includes , apart from the <unk> meaning of words , more information . this information is based on how the speaker <unk> to be understood and how he himself sees his relation to the receiver of information . relationship is the command part of the message or how it is <unk> said . content is the report or what is said verbally . being able to interpret both of these aspects is essential in understanding something that a communicator said . the <unk> aspect of interaction is known as metacommunication . metacommunication is communication about communication . relationship messages are always the most important element in communication . the nature of a relationship is dependent on the <unk> of the partners ' communication procedures : both the <unk> and the receiver of information structure the communication flow differently and therefore interpret their own behavior during communicating as merely a reaction on the other 's behavior ( i.e. , every partner <unk> the other one is the cause of a specific behavior ) . to <unk> a communication means to interpret an ongoing sequence of events by <unk> one event as the cause and the following event as the response . in a situation with communication , if one thing happens , something else always happens . for example , a female in a relationship with a male is feeling <unk> . the male in the relationship with the female <unk> guilty . one who <unk> this situation might ask , `` is she <unk> because of his guilt , or does he feel guilty because of her depression ? '' human communication involves both digital and analog <unk> : this axiom refers back to the use of <unk> and system strategy explained in the first axiom . it is mostly related to the digital content of communication within a relationship . <unk> communication procedures are either <unk> or complementary : this axiom focuses on metacommunication with two main components called symmetrical interchange and complementary interchange . symmetrical interchange is an interaction based on equal power between communicators . in accordance to that , complementary interchange is an interaction based on differences in power . within these two <unk> there are three different ways they can be used : one-up , one-down , and one-across . with a one-up communication , one communicator attempts to gain control of an exchange by <unk> the overall communication . a one-down communication has the opposite effect . a communicator attempts to yield control of an interaction or submit to someone . the final message is a one-across communication . this communication moves to <unk> a situation . this is also called transitory if only one communicator is attempting this style . when two communicators use the same style of one-up , one-down , or one-across , it is symmetrical . if they are opposing one another it is complementary . this axiom allows us to understand how an interaction can be perceived by the <unk> a communicator is using . === additional notions === some interrelated notions that make up the interactional view promoted by watzlawick and colleagues at the mri include : one can not not communicate , and the related idea that one can not not influence ; understanding behavior as if we are constantly exchanging messages defining the nature of relationships of which we are a part ; shifting focus of attention from intent to the effects of behavior as communication ; <unk> <unk> ; emphasizing the vital role of the therapist 's <unk> in bringing forth socially constructed reality ; investing the ramifications of <unk> <unk> ; and <unk> and fully embracing the `` as if '' nature of <unk> term that is used often in the theory of the interactional view is <unk> . an <unk> is within <unk> culture ; a person whose <unk> behavior allows others to continue in their <unk> abuse . an example of this would be a person letting their <unk> continue to act in an <unk> manner because that is what the family is used to him doing . another word frequently used in the interactional view is <unk> . someone in a <unk> , is a person trapped by expectations ; the powerful party requests that the <unk> party act <unk> . an example of this would be a person asking another person , `` why did n't you like the movie ? '' or `` you like rock <unk> ' roll , do n't you ? '' the first person is asking the second person to act in a way that is similar ( symmetrical ) to them . === criticisms === the critique of this theory can be centered on one main thing : the application of the theory as a whole . being able to take these axioms and apply them to relationships between families can be very difficult to master . it can be said that this theory is trapped because it is so hard to apply . also , the theory itself does not claim and exact applications other than `` <unk> '' . <unk> asks the communicators to step outside of the situation and <unk> what it means . this can be hard because the theory states that only an outside source can see a problem because people are `` speaking their own language '' . this theory also shows how a relationship has already changed , but it does not give practical ways to go about changing it . this system <unk> change and it can be hard to actively use the five axioms . related to the first axiom , <unk> communication can be viewed as <unk> rather than <unk> . with the behavioral characteristic of <unk> involved , it is hard to know when the system of the interactional view is happening or not . <unk> is the systems theory assumption that a given outcome could have occurred due to any or many interconnected factors rather than being a result in a <unk> relationship . this theory rests on the word communication , but this word can be interpreted very differently between people . the definitions of communication can be very controversial . overall , the axioms do a great job of explaining problems , but do not provide solutions to the problems they bring up . this critique does fail however to acknowledge watzlawick 's influence on the development of brief therapy , a <unk> important and influential school of psychotherapy which is only too practical and <unk> in helping people make changes . == publications == watzlawick wrote <integer> books that were translated into <integer> languages for academic and general audiences with more than <integer> scientific articles and book chapters . books he has written or on which he has collaborated include : an anthology of human communication , <year> pragmatics of human communication ( with beavin and jackson ) , <year> , oclc <unk> change : principles of problem formation and problem resolution ( with john weakland and richard fisch ) , <year> , oclc <integer> , w w norton page how real is real ? , <year> , oclc <unk> the language of change , <year> , oclc <integer> , w w norton page <unk> für amerika , <year> the situation is hopeless , but not serious : the pursuit of <unk> , <year> , oclc <integer> , w w norton page the invented reality : how do we know what we believe we know ?

'' in other words , it is up to the individual and within their own decision whether or not to have children . the second is that if a society sees not having children as <unk> , then fertility will decline . the third <unk> is to have <unk> methods ready . it is important to emphasize that a society will start to show signs of fertility decline if these three <unk> are <unk> in <year> , the project resulted in the publication of nine major books <unk> the change in <unk> over a century in the <integer> provinces in europe . the project findings eventually led to the conclusion that even though economical factors can play a role in fertility decline , this is not the absolute determinant of fertility decline . the european fertility project led to a better understanding that infant mortality and fertility decline do not necessarily follow each other . with a long-time interest in the population of russia , which first found <unk> in coale 's work on the life tables that he constructed for frank <unk> 's classic the population of the soviet union ( <year> ) , coale also later co-authored a volume on russia for the european fertility project <unk> the end of his career , coale became interested in the population changes in china and understanding the fertility transition there as well as factors affecting the sex ratio at birth . in a <year> study he conducted , india and china were compared in both their population size and fertility trends . a survey named the `` <unk> fertility survey '' reached out to women living in various provinces of china and asked them to relate a brief history of their marital status and a family planning discussion . the survey contributed to an understanding of the population and fertility changes that would occur in china shortly after . published in a journal article called population trends in china and india , coale introduced the possible causes of differences in fertility trends in such highly populated countries . these reasons are based on policies put in place to reduce birth rates as well as some cultural differences that come into play . finally , coale presents the future of both countries and states that despite the efforts to reduce birth rates , the countries will remain the most populated . == honors == coale was a member of the national academy of sciences , the american academy of arts and sciences and the american philosophical society , and was a recipient of several honorary degrees from universities including princeton , the university of pennsylvania , the university of louvain and the university of liège . he was also a corresponding fellow of the british academy . == selected bibliography == coale , ansley j .

<integer> <month> <year> ) was a swiss economist . == biography == karl brunner was born in zurich on <integer> <month> <year>. he studied economics at the university of zurich and the london school of economics , and earned a doctorate at the university of zurich in <year>. he left switzerland in <year> to take up a position as a visiting fellow at the cowles commission , university of chicago . after a two-year fellowship , brunner moved to los angeles in <year> to begin an academic career at the university of california ( ucla ) , where he worked his way up from assistant professor to associate professor and , from <year> , to full professor . in <year> , he was appointed professor at the ohio state university , before moving to the university of rochester in <year>. in the <year>s , brunner frequently returned to europe after accepting a professorship at the university of konstanz , germany ( <unk> ) and subsequently the university of bern , switzerland ( <year>–1985 ) . in <year> , brunner was named the fred h. <unk> professor of economics at the university of rochester , a position he held until his death on <integer> <month> <year> . over his professional career of <integer> years , karl brunner wrote <integer> journal articles , <integer> books , edited or co-edited <integer> volumes , contributed <integer> articles to books , volumes , conferences and congressional hearings , and left behind <integer> unpublished papers . he founded two leading academic journals , namely the journal of money , credit , and banking ( in <year> ) and the journal of monetary economics ( in <year> ) . he also originated the konstanz , <unk> and <unk> ( with allan meltzer ) meetings , as well as the shadow open market committee ( in <year> , again with meltzer ) . to commemorate the <days> anniversary of his birthday , the swiss national bank started the karl brunner distinguished lecture series in <year>. the first lecture was given by kenneth <unk> in zurich . == monetarism == karl brunner introduced in <year> the term monetarism into the mainstream <unk> of economics . fundamentally , brunner conceived monetarism as the application of <unk> theory to the analysis of aggregate phenomena . in his interview with <unk> klamer , he notably claimed that : “ the basic tenet of monetarism is the <unk> of the relevance of price theory to understand what happens in aggregate economics . our fundamental point is that price theory is a crucial paradigm – as a matter of fact , the only paradigm – that economists have ” ( klamer <year> , p. <integer> ) . this particular conception of monetarism seems closely related to brunner ’ s experience at ucla : “ most <unk> was moreover the encounter with a group of economists systematically applying economic analysis ( i.e . price theory ) to social problems of our world . the resulting <unk> yielded a <unk> ground for the right environment , and ucla at the beginning of the <year>s was for me the right place . the permanent discussion with a <unk> mind ( <unk> a. alchian ) , the impact of a lucid philosopher of science ( reichenbach ) , and the good fortune of questioning and determined students ( allan h. meltzer , tibor <unk> , later on jerry jordan and others ) dispersed the intellectual <unk> and gradually structured my thinking about economics and its role in our <unk> to understand the world ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . similarly , to the question “ when did you become a monetarist ? ” , brunner answered : “ i find it actually quite interesting in retrospect to <unk> the question in my discussions with alchian ” ( klamer <year> , p. <integer> ) . more specifically , brunner considered that “ the major propositions characterizing the monetarist view can be organized into four groups . these groups bear on descriptions of the transmission mechanism , the dynamic properties of the private sector , the dominance and nature of the monetary <unk> and the separation of aggregate and <unk> forces ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . == the transmission of monetary policy == in the above <unk> , as well as in other accounts of the main propositions characterizing monetarism , karl brunner systematically mentioned the transmission mechanism of monetary policy first . according to brunner and allan meltzer ( <year> ) , a monetarist transmission mechanism is such that “ changes in money modify relative prices and <unk> a process of substitution that <unk> to the markets for existing capital securities , loans and current output ” ( p. <integer> ) . the central role played by <unk> movements led brunner to use the terms <unk> process ' and <unk> process ' <unk> . he actually perceived the transmission mechanism as “ a suitable application of relative price theory ” to explain output and employment fluctuations ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . more precisely , the transmission mechanism of monetary policy considered by brunner and meltzer relies on the relative behavior of two prices . first , the price of existing real assets , <unk> by p , which is actually the price of existing real capital . second , the price of output , <unk> by p , which is the price of the item used both for building new real capital and for consumption purposes . moreover , brunner and meltzer assumed that the costs of acquiring information are smaller in the assets markets than in the output market . as a result , the speed of adjustment of p in response to shocks is higher than that of p . an increase in the growth rate of money supply thus implies a rise in the ratio of p to p. this means that the price of new capital has fallen relative to the price of existing capital , <unk> private investment ( i.e . the production of new capital ) . furthermore , a rise in the p to p ratio also <unk> a positive wealth effect and then an increase in private consumption . hence , an expansionary monetary policy raises each component of private aggregate spending through an increase in <unk> . it is worth noting that this mechanism is close to the one set out by james tobin ( the so-called tobin ’ s q ) in <year> . == the origin of money == in <year> , karl brunner and allan meltzer delivered an analysis of the origin of money as a medium of exchange . the <unk> of the explanation presented there were first set out in a paper published in <year> in the journal of finance ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <unk> ) . the crucial <unk> is the absence of perfect information about the quality of the goods households seek to purchase . searching for information about the quality of goods involves some costs , whose amount <unk> substantially across goods . in this context , the goods with comparatively lower information costs for most households will <unk> as media of exchange : “ where knowledge of market opportunities and the qualities of goods is neither <unk> to obtain nor <unk> distributed , the use of money as a medium of exchange reduces the resource cost of exchanging ... for individuals , money is a substitute for investment in information and labor <unk> to search . by using money , individuals reduce the amount of information they must acquire , process , and store , and they reduce the number of transactions in which they engage to exchange their initial <unk> for optimal <unk> of goods ” ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <integer> ) . == monetary policy and the defense of money growth rules == in the <year>s , karl brunner ( largely <unk> with milton friedman ) considered that the <unk> literature on optimal policy , in which “ the policy maker is given complete knowledge of the structural relations <unk> to the economy and a set of goal variables that enter the social utility function ” ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <integer> ) , missed the essential point of the real-world policy problem . in collaboration with allan meltzer , brunner proposed an analytic framework <unk> “ targets and indicators of monetary policy ” , in which monetary policy could <unk> be discussed and criticized . in the words of brunner and meltzer ( <year> ) , “ the problem of selecting an indicator of monetary policy is equivalent to the problem of finding a scale that allows us to make reliable statements comparing the thrust of various policy combinations ” ( p. <integer> ) . under conditions of complete knowledge , the indicator problem is totally <unk> . in this case , indeed , the thrust of any policy combination on any variable can always be calculated with <unk> accuracy . under uncertainty , however , things are different . for example , brunner and meltzer showed that , within their framework , the behavior of free reserves ( a widely deployed guide to the stance of monetary policy in the <year>s ) was not <unk> related to the <unk> or <unk> of policy conceived of in such terms . therefore , to rely upon it was to run the risk of <unk> policy 's stance , perhaps rendering it <unk> and destabilizing . karl brunner later defended money growth rules of the type proposed by milton friedman . he became convinced that , though <unk> policy did sometimes deliver “ phases of remarkably stability and growth ... such phases depend essentially on transitory political <unk> ” ( <year> , p. <integer> ) . thus “ the nature of the monetary order and not the specific actions within a <unk> regime emerged in recent years as the central issue of a more fundamental policy problem ” ( p. <integer> ) . as a result , there is a clear “ advantage of a monetary order based on a constant monetary growth ” ( p. <integer> ) . == the criticism of walrasian economics == a short time before passing away , karl brunner defined monetarism as a “ <unk> ' programme of a <unk> tradition ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . walrasian economics would notably be unable to account for the emergence of many institutions , and especially money : “ the walrasian paradigm , based on the absence of information and transaction costs , necessarily <unk> all social phenomena conditioned by the operation of such costs . with full information and in the absence of any transaction costs there is no reason for the occurrence of money , on financial <unk> and no <unk> for many other social institutions ... important problems of our monetary and financial reality remain inaccessible to such a walrasian tradition ” ( p. <integer> ) . among <unk> economists , karl brunner focused attention on the authors of new classical macroeconomics ( <unk> ) . a first criticism directed towards ncm relates to the rational expectations hypothesis . under this hypothesis , “ people are assumed to know the policy rule used by the monetary ( and fiscal ) authorities and to have detailed knowledge about the structure of the economy including the size and timing of responses to shocks of various kinds . these assumptions make the models <unk> <unk> but , taken literally ( as they often are ) , they <unk> the economist 's view of the policy problem by ignoring uncertainty , incomplete knowledge about the structure of the economy and the costs of acquiring information and reducing uncertainty ” ( brunner and meltzer <year> , p. <integer> ) . a second criticism addressed by brunner to ncm concerns the <unk> concept of equilibrium : “ i also have strong reservations about crucial aspects of their <unk> approach ' ” ( klamer <year> , p. <integer> ) . to the question “ so what is wrong with new classical economics ? ” , brunner answered : “ their interpretation of equilibrium analysis seems dubious to me . this specific kind of equilibrium analysis implies that all prices are <unk> relative to all <unk> ” ( p. <integer> ) . as a result , ncm can not explain “ the lamented <unk> of prices to current conditions ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) , i.e . price <unk> . == philosophy of science and evolutionary perspective == looking back on his career , karl brunner considered that he had paid attention to “ three distinct major groups of problems . one <unk> the range of monetary analysis and policy and a second involves the nature of our cognitive <unk> expressed by our <unk> . the last <unk> of my <unk> interests developed over time from my occupation with the previous two problems . there evolved a gradual understanding that economic analysis offers a systematic approach to the whole range of <unk> reality ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . this section deals with the second and third groups . in a paper entitled “ assumptions and the cognitive quality of <unk> ” , karl brunner argued that milton friedman ( in his famous “ methodology of positive economics ” ) had been right that “ the cognitive quality of a theory can not be judged by the realism of <unk> ' but must be judged by the confrontation of its implications with suitable observations ” ( brunner <year> , p. <integer> ) . brunner further stressed the <unk> of ever obtaining definitive confirmation of any general theory from a finite array of empirical evidence . rather , and like karl popper ( <year> ) , he pointed out the capacity of such evidence to <unk> theories . at the same time , “ it is , however , important to <unk> that actual <unk> by a <unk> test statement is a necessary but far from sufficient reason to reject a theory . our choice is frequently between quite imperfect theories , i.e. , theories which had ( sic ) been <unk> posed to some <unk> <unk> . the comparative extent of <unk> <unk> the decision and not <unk> as

<month> <integer> , <year> – <month> <integer> , <year> ) was an american economist and statistician who received the <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for his research on consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy . with george stigler and others , friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the chicago school of economics , a neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the work of the faculty at the university of chicago that rejected <unk> in favor of monetarism until the <unk> , when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations . several students , young professors and academics who were recruited or <unk> by friedman at chicago went on to become leading economists , including gary becker , robert <unk> , thomas <unk> and robert lucas <unk> 's challenges to what he later called `` <unk> keynesian theory '' began with his interpretation of consumption , which tracks how consumers spend . he introduced a theory which would later become part of the mainstream and among the first to propagate the theory of consumption smoothing . during the <year>s he became the main advocate opposing keynesian government policies , and described his approach ( along with mainstream economics ) as using `` keynesian language and apparatus '' yet rejecting its initial conclusions . he theorized that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to <unk> . he argued that the phillips curve was in the long run <unk> at the `` natural rate '' and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation . friedman promoted a macroeconomic viewpoint known as monetarism and argued that a steady , small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy , as compared to rapid , and unexpected changes . his ideas concerning monetary policy , taxation , privatization and deregulation influenced government policies , especially during the <year>s . his monetary theory influenced the federal reserve 's monetary policy in response to the global financial crisis of <unk> retiring from the university of chicago in <year> , and becoming emeritus professor in economics in <year> , friedman was an advisor to republican president ronald reagan and conservative british prime minister margaret thatcher . his political philosophy <unk> the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal government intervention in social matters . he once stated that his role in eliminating conscription in the united states was his proudest achievement . in his <year> book capitalism and freedom , friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military , freely floating exchange rates , abolition of medical <unk> , a negative income tax and school vouchers and opposition to the war on drugs and support for drug liberalization policies . his support for school choice led him to found the friedman foundation for educational choice , later renamed <unk> 's works cover a broad range of economic topics and public policy issues . his books and essays have had global influence , including in former communist states . a <year> survey of economists commissioned by the <unk> ranked friedman as the <unk> popular economist of the <days> century , following only john <month>nard keynes . upon his death , the economist described him as `` the most influential economist of the second half of the <days> century ... possibly of all of it '' . == early life == friedman was born in brooklyn , new york on <month> <integer> , <year>. his parents , <unk> ethel ( née landau ) and <unk> saul friedman , were jewish working-class immigrants from <unk> in <unk> <unk> , kingdom of hungary ( now <unk> in ukraine ) . they emigrated to america in their early teens . they both worked as <unk> goods merchants . friedman was their fourth child and only son . shortly after his birth , the family relocated to rahway , new <unk> 's family experienced financial <unk> , and financial uncertainty caused stability of income to be low . friedman described his family 's situation in the following manner : the family income was small and highly uncertain ; financial crisis was a constant companion . yet there was always enough to eat , and the family atmosphere was warm and <unk> 's father , <unk> saul friedman , died during friedman 's senior year of high school , leaving friedman and two older sisters to care for his mother , <unk> ethel <unk> his early teens , friedman was injured in a car accident , which <unk> his upper <unk> . a talented student and an avid reader , friedman graduated from rahway high school in <year> , just before his <days> birthday . although no family members had gone to university before milton , friedman was awarded a competitive scholarship to rutgers university ( then a private university receiving limited support from the state of new jersey , e.g. , for such scholarships ) . friedman was expected to finance the cost of university himself . he graduated from rutgers in <year>.friedman initially intended to become an actuary or mathematician , however the state of the economy , which was at this point in a deep depression , convinced him to become an economist . he was offered two scholarships to do graduate work , one in mathematics at brown university and the other in economics at the university of chicago , where he would later teach . friedman chose the latter , earning a master of arts degree in <year>. he was strongly influenced by jacob viner , frank knight , and henry simons . friedman met his future wife , economist rose director , while at the university of <unk> the <unk> academic year , he had a fellowship at columbia university , where he studied statistics with statistician and economist harold hotelling . he was back in chicago for the <year>–1935 academic year , working as a research assistant for henry schultz , who was then working on theory and measurement of <unk> the <unk> <unk> academic year , friedman formed what would later prove to be lifetime <unk> with george stigler and w. allen wallis , both of whom taught with friedman at the university of chicago . == public service == friedman was unable to find academic employment , so in <year> he followed his friend w. allen wallis to washington , d.c. , where franklin d. roosevelt 's new deal was `` a <unk> '' for many young economists . at this stage , friedman said he and his wife `` regarded the <unk> programs such as the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> appropriate responses to the critical situation , '' but not `` the <unk> and <unk> measures of the national recovery administration and the agricultural adjustment administration . '' <unk> his later ideas , he believed price controls interfered with an essential <unk> mechanism to help resources be used where they were most valued . indeed , friedman later concluded that all government intervention associated with the new deal was `` the wrong cure for the wrong disease , '' arguing the federal reserve was to blame , and that they should have expanded the money supply in reaction to what he later described in a monetary history of the united states as `` the great contraction . '' later , friedman and his colleague anna schwartz wrote a monetary history of the united states , <year>–1960 , which argued that the great depression was caused by a severe monetary contraction due to banking crises and poor policy on the part of the federal reserve . robert j. <unk> describes the book as the `` most influential account '' of the great depression . during <year> , he began working for the national resources planning board , which was then working on a large consumer budget survey . ideas from this project later became a part of his theory of the consumption function , a book which first described consumption smoothing and the permanent income hypothesis . friedman began employment with the national bureau of economic research during the autumn of <year> to assist simon <unk> in his work on professional income . this work resulted in their jointly authored publication incomes from independent professional practice , which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income , a major component of the permanent income hypothesis that friedman worked out in greater detail in the <year>s . the book hypothesizes that professional <unk> artificially <unk> the supply of services and raises <unk> from independent professional practice remained quite controversial within the economics community because of friedman 's hypothesis that barriers to entry , which were exercised and <unk> by the american medical association , led to higher than average wages for physicians , compared to other professional groups . barriers to entry are a fixed cost which must be incurred regardless of any outside factors such as work experience , or other factors of human <unk> <year> , friedman was appointed as an assistant professor teaching economics at the university of wisconsin–madison , but encountered anti <unk> in the economics department and returned to government service . from <year> to <year> friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government , as an advisor to senior officials of the united states department of the treasury . as a treasury spokesman during <year> , he advocated a keynesian policy of taxation . he helped to <unk> the <unk> withholding tax system , since the federal government needed money to fund the war . he later said , `` i have no <unk> for it , but i really wish we had n't found it necessary and i wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now . '' in milton and rose friedman 's <unk> memoir , he wrote , `` rose has repeatedly <unk> me over the years about the role that i played in making possible the current <unk> government we both criticize so strongly . '' == academic career == === early years === in <year> , friedman accepted a position at the university of wisconsin–madison , but left because of differences with faculty regarding united states involvement in world war ii . friedman believed the united states should enter the war . in <year> , friedman joined the division of war research at columbia university ( headed by w. allen wallis and harold hotelling ) , where he spent the rest of world war ii working as a mathematical statistician , focusing on problems of weapons design , military tactics , and metallurgical <unk> <year> , friedman submitted incomes from independent professional practice ( co-authored with <unk> and completed during <year> ) to columbia as his doctoral dissertation . the university awarded him a phd in <year>. friedman spent the <year>–1946 academic year teaching at the university of minnesota ( where his friend george stigler was employed ) . on <month> <integer> , <year> , his only son , david d. friedman , who would later follow in his father 's footsteps as an economist was born . === university of chicago === in <year> , friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the university of chicago ( a position opened by departure of his former professor jacob viner to princeton university ) . friedman would work for the university of chicago for the next <integer> years . there he contributed to the establishment of an intellectual community that produced a number of nobel memorial prize winners , known collectively as the chicago school of <unk> the time , arthur f. burns , who was then the head of the national bureau of economic research , and later chairman of the federal reserve , asked friedman to <unk> the bureau 's staff . he accepted the invitation , and assumed responsibility for the bureau 's inquiry into the role of money in the business cycle . as a result , he initiated the `` workshop in money and banking '' ( the `` chicago workshop '' ) , which promoted a revival of monetary studies . during the latter half of the <year>s , friedman began a collaboration with anna schwartz , an economic historian at the bureau , that would ultimately result in the <year> publication of a book co-authored by friedman and schwartz , a monetary history of the united states , <unk> spent the <year>–1955 academic year as a fulbright visiting fellow at gonville and caius college , cambridge . at the time , the cambridge economics faculty was divided into a keynesian majority ( including joan robinson and richard <unk> ) and an <unk> minority ( headed by dennis robertson ) . friedman speculated he was invited to the fellowship because his views were unacceptable to both of the cambridge factions . later his weekly columns for newsweek magazine ( <unk> ) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people , and helped earn the magazine a gerald <unk> special award in <year>. from <year> to <year> , he and paul samuelson participated in the economics <unk> series , a <unk> subscription series where the economist would discuss the days ' issues for about a <unk> at a time . ==== a theory of the consumption function ==== one of milton friedman 's most popular works , a theory of the consumption function , challenged traditional keynesian viewpoints about the household . this work was originally published in <year> by princeton university press , and it <unk> the relationship displayed `` between aggregate consumption or aggregate savings and aggregate income . '' friedman 's counterpart keynes believed people would modify their household consumption expenditures to relate to their existing income levels . friedman 's research introduced the term `` permanent income '' to the world , which was the average of a household 's expected income over several years , and he also developed the permanent income hypothesis . friedman thought income consisted of several components , namely transitory and permanent . he established the formula y = y p + y t { \displaystyle <unk> { p } <unk> { t } } in order to calculate income , with p representing the permanent component , and t representing the transitory <unk> friedman 's research changed how economists interpreted the consumption function , and his work pushed the idea that current income was not the only factor affecting people 's adjustment household consumption expenditures . instead , expected income levels also affected how households would change their consumption expenditures . friedman 's contributions strongly influenced research on consumer behavior , and he further defined how to predict consumption smoothing , which <unk> keynes ' marginal <unk> to <unk> . although this work presented many controversial points of view which <unk> from existing viewpoints established by keynes , a theory of the consumption function helped friedman gain respect in the field of economics . his work on the permanent income hypothesis is among the many contributions which were listed as reasons for his <unk> prize in economic sciences . his work was later expanded on by christopher d. carroll , especially in regards to the absence of liquidity <unk> permanent income hypothesis faces some criticism , mainly from keynesian economists . the primary criticism of the hypothesis is based on a lack of liquidity constraints . ==== capitalism and freedom ==== his book capitalism and freedom , inspired by a series of lectures he gave at <unk> college , brought him national and international attention outside academia . it was published in <year> by the university of chicago press and consists of essays that used non-mathematical economic models to explore issues of public policy . it sold over <other>00,000 copies in the first eighteen years and more than half a million since <year>. capitalism and freedom was translated into eighteen languages . friedman talks about the need to move to a <unk> liberal society , that free markets would help nations and individuals in the <unk> and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the united states and other major countries of the <year>s and <year>s . he goes through the chapters <unk> an issue in each respective chapter from the role of government and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational <unk> . friedman concludes capitalism and freedom with his `` classical liberal [ sic ] '' stance that government should stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country . he <unk> how the best of a country 's abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention . == <unk> == in <year> , at the age of <integer> , friedman retired from the university of chicago after teaching there for <integer> years . he and his wife moved to san francisco , where he became a visiting scholar at the federal reserve bank of san francisco . from <year> on , he was affiliated with the hoover institution at stanford university . during <year> , friedman was approached by bob <unk> and the free to choose network . they asked him to create a television program presenting his economic and social <unk> and his wife rose worked on this project for the next three years , and during <year> , the <unk> series , titled free to choose , was broadcast by the public broadcasting service ( pbs ) . the companion book to the series ( co-authored by milton and his wife , rose friedman ) , also titled free to choose , was the <unk> <unk> book of <year>.friedman served as an unofficial adviser to ronald reagan during his <year> presidential campaign , and then served on the president 's economic policy advisory board for the rest of the reagan administration . <unk> says friedman was `` the <unk> ' of the reagan administration . '' in <year> he received the national medal of science and reagan honored him with the presidential medal of <unk> is known now as one of the most influential economists of the <days> century . throughout the <year>s and <year>s , friedman continued to write editorials and appear on television . he made several visits to eastern europe and to china , where he also advised governments . he was also for many years a trustee of the philadelphia society . == personal life == friedman had two children , david and <unk> he first met his wife , rose friedman ( née director ) , at the university of chicago in <year> , and later <unk> six years later , in <year>.friedman was <unk> <unk> than some of his colleagues ; he measured <decimal> meters ( <decimal> ft ) , and has been described as an `` <unk> libertarian '' by <unk> <unk> friedman , when asked about friedman 's successes , said that “ i have never had the desire to compete with milton <unk> ( perhaps because i was smart enough to recognize i could n't ) . on the other hand , he has always made me feel that his achievement is my achievement . `` during the <year>s , friedman built , and subsequently maintained a cottage in <unk> , vermont . friedman also had an apartment in russian hill , san francisco , where he lived from <year> until his death . === religious views === according to a <year> article in commentary magazine , his `` parents were <unk> <unk> jews , but friedman , after an intense <unk> of childhood <unk> , rejected religion altogether . '' he described himself as an agnostic . friedman wrote extensively of his life and experiences , especially in <year> in his memoirs with his wife , rose , titled two <unk> people . in this book , rose friedman describes how she and milton friedman raised their two children , janet and david , with a christmas tree in the home . `` orthodox jews of course , do not celebrate christmas . however , just as , when i was a child , my mother had permitted me to have a christmas tree one year when my friend had one , she not only tolerated our having a christmas tree , she even <unk> <unk> to <unk> on it . '' === death === friedman died of heart failure at the age of <integer> years in san francisco on <month> <integer> , <year>. he was still a working economist performing original economic research ; his last column was published in the wall street journal the day after his death . he was survived by his wife , rose friedman ( who would die on <month> <integer> , <year> ) and their two children , david d. friedman , known for the machinery of freedom , as well as his unique <unk> from a chicago school perspective , and attorney and bridge player jan <unk> . == scholarly contributions == === economics === friedman was best known for <unk> interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal value of output , that is , the quantity theory of money . monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory . its origins can be traced back to the <days>-century school of <unk> or even further ; however , friedman 's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization . he co-authored , with anna schwartz , a monetary history of the united states , <year>–1960 ( <year> ) , which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the u.s. <unk> was the main proponent of the monetarist school of economics . he maintained that there is a close and stable association between inflation and the money supply , mainly that inflation could be avoided with proper regulation of the monetary base 's growth rate . he famously used the analogy of `` <unk> money out of a <unk> '' , in order to avoid dealing with money <unk> mechanisms and other factors that would <unk> his <unk> 's arguments were designed to counter the popular concept of <unk> inflation , that the increased general price level at the time was the result of increases in the price of oil , or increases in wages ; as he wrote : inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon . friedman rejected the use of fiscal policy as a tool of demand management ; and he held that the government 's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely . friedman wrote extensively on the great depression , and he termed the <unk> period the great contraction . he argued that the depression had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and <unk> were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the <unk> policies of the directors of the federal reserve . the fed was largely responsible for <unk> what might have been a <unk> recession , although perhaps a fairly severe one , into a major catastrophe . instead of using its powers to <unk> the depression , it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by <unk> from <year> to <year> ... far from the depression being a failure of the <unk> system , it was a <unk> failure of government . this theory was put forth in a monetary history of the united states , and the chapter on the great depression was then published as a <unk> book entitled the great contraction , <unk> . both books are still in print from the princeton university press , and some editions include as an appendix a speech at a university of chicago event honoring friedman in which ben <unk> made this statement : let me end my talk by <unk> slightly my status as an official representative of the federal reserve . i would like to say to milton and anna : regarding the great depression , you 're right . we did it . we 're very sorry . but thanks to you , we wo n't do it again . friedman also argued for the removal of government intervention in currency markets , thereby <unk> an enormous literature on the subject , as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates . his close friend george stigler explained , `` as is customary in science , he did not win a full victory , in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations , a <unk> approach developed by robert lucas , also at the university of chicago . '' the relationship between friedman and lucas , or new classical macroeconomics as a whole , was highly complex . the friedmanian phillips curve was an interesting starting point for lucas , but he soon realized that the solution provided by friedman was not quite satisfactory . lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the friedmanian adaptive expectations . due to this reformulation , the story in which the theory of the new classical phillips curve was embedded radically changed . this modification , however , had a significant effect on friedman 's own approach , so , as a result , the theory of the friedmanian phillips curve also changed . moreover , new classical <unk> neil wallace , who was a graduate student at the university of chicago between <year> and <year> , regarded friedman 's theoretical courses as a mess , <unk> the <unk> relationship between monetarism and new classical <unk> was also known for his work on the consumption function , the permanent income hypothesis ( <year> ) , which friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work . this work contended that <unk> consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income . permanent income refers to such factors like human capital . <unk> gains would mostly be saved because of the law of diminishing marginal <unk> 's essay `` the methodology of positive economics '' ( <year> ) provided the <unk> pattern for his own subsequent research and to a degree that of the chicago school . there he argued that economics as science should be free of value <unk> for it to be objective . moreover , a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and <unk> as an engine of prediction . that is , students should measure the accuracy of its predictions , rather than the <unk> of its assumptions ' . his argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as jerzy neyman , leonard savage , and ronald <unk> , despite being an advocate of the free market , milton friedman believed that the government had two crucial roles . in an interview with phil <unk> , milton friedman argued that `` the two basic functions of a government are to protect the nation against foreign enemy , and to protect citizens against its <unk> ” he also admitted that although privatization of national defense could reduce the overall cost , he has not yet thought of a way to make this privatization possible . === rejection and subsequent evolution of the <unk> curve === other important contributions include his critique of the phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment ( <year> ) . this critique associated his name , together with that of edmund <unk> , with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation can not permanently reduce unemployment by doing so . unemployment <month> be temporarily lower , if the inflation is a surprise , but in the long run unemployment will be determined by the <unk> and <unk> of the labor market . if the conditions are not met and inflation is expected , the `` long run '' effects will replace the `` short term '' <unk> his critique , the <unk> curve evolved from a strict model emphasizing the connection between inflation and unemployment as being absolute , to a model which emphasized short term unemployment reductions and long term employment <unk> 's revised and updated phillips curve also changed as a result of robert lucas 's idea of rational expectations , replacing the adaptive expectations friedman used . === statistics === one of his most famous contributions to statistics is <unk> <unk> . friedman did statistical work at the division of war research at columbia , where he and his colleagues came up with the technique . it became , in the words of the new palgrave dictionary of economics , `` the standard analysis of quality control inspection '' . the dictionary adds , `` like many of friedman 's contributions , in retrospect it seems remarkably simple and obvious to apply basic economic ideas to quality control ; that , however , is a measure of his genius . '' == public policy positions == === federal reserve and monetary policy === although friedman concluded the government does have a role in the monetary system he was critical of the federal reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished . he was opposed to federal reserve policies , even during the so-called <unk> shock ' that was labeled <unk> ' . friedman believed the federal reserve system should ultimately be replaced with a computer program . he favored a system that would <unk> buy and sell securities in response to changes in the money <unk> proposal to constantly grow the money supply at a certain <unk> amount every year has become known as friedman 's <unk> rule . there is debate about the effectiveness of a theoretical money supply targeting regime . the fed 's inability to meet its money supply targets from <year>–1982 led some to conclude it is not a feasible alternative to more conventional inflation and interest rate targeting . towards the end of his life , friedman expressed doubt about the validity of targeting the quantity of money . to date , most countries have adopted inflation targeting instead of the <unk> <unk> , friedman actually favored the principles of the <year>s chicago plan , which would have ended fractional reserve banking and , thus , private money creation . it would force banks to have <integer> % reserves backing deposits , and instead place money creation powers solely in the hands of the us government . this would make targeting money growth more possible , as endogenous money created by fractional reserve lending would no longer be a major <unk> was a strong advocate for floating exchange rates throughout the entire <unk> period ( <unk> ) . he argued that a flexible exchange rate would make external adjustment possible and allow countries to avoid balance of payments crises . he saw fixed exchange rates as an undesirable form of government intervention . the case was <unk> in an influential <year> paper , `` the case for flexible exchange rates , '' at a time when most commentators regarded the possibility of floating exchange rates as an unrealistic policy proposal . === foreign policy === while walter <unk> is credited with establishing the economic basis for a volunteer military , friedman was a proponent , and was credited with ending the draft , stating that the draft was `` inconsistent with a free society . `` in capitalism and freedom , he argued conscription is <unk> and arbitrary , preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit . during the nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to <unk> armed force . he would later state his role in eliminating the conscription in the united states was his proudest accomplishment . friedman did , however , believe the introduction of a system of universal military training as a reserve in cases of <unk> could be justified . he still opposed its implementation in the united states , describing it as a “ <unk> ” <unk> <unk> <unk> noted a drift over time in friedman 's views from an <unk> to a more cautious foreign policy . he supported us involvement in the second world war and initially supported a <unk> against communism , but <unk> over time . however , friedman did state in a <year> interview that he was an <unk> . he opposed the gulf war and the iraq war . in a spring <year> interview , friedman said the us 's stature in the world had been <unk> by the iraq war , but that it might be improved if iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country . === libertarianism and the republican party === friedman was an economic advisor and speech writer in barry goldwater 's failed presidential campaign in <year>. he was an advisor to california governor ronald reagan , and was active in reagan 's presidential campaigns . he served as a member of president reagan 's economic policy advisory board starting in <year>. in <year> , he received the presidential medal of freedom and the national medal of <unk> stated that he was a libertarian <unk> , but a member of the u.s. republican party for the sake of `` <unk> '' ( `` i am a libertarian with a small ' l ' and a republican with a capital ' r . ' and i am a republican with a capital ' r ' on grounds of <unk> , not on principle . '' ) but , he said , `` i think the term classical liberal is also equally applicable . i do n't really care very much what i 'm called . i 'm much more interested in having people thinking about the ideas , rather than the person . `` his citation for the presidential medal of freedom reads : `` he has used a brilliant mind to advance a moral vision : the vision of a society where men and women are free , free to choose , but where government is not as free to override their decisions . that vision has changed america , and it is changing the world . all of us <unk> a tremendous debt to this man ’ s <unk> intellect and his devotion to liberty . '' === governmental involvement in the economy === friedman was supportive of the state provision of some public goods that private businesses are not considered as being able to provide . however , he argued that many of the services performed by government could be performed better by the private sector . above all , if some public goods are provided by the state , he believed that they should not be a legal monopoly where private competition is prohibited ; for example , he wrote : there is no way to justify our present public monopoly of the post office . it <month> be argued that the carrying of mail is a technical monopoly and that a government monopoly is the least of <unk> . along these lines , one could perhaps justify a government post office , but not the present law , which makes it illegal for anybody else to carry the mail . if the delivery of mail is a technical monopoly , no one else will be able to succeed in competition with the government . if it is not , there is no reason why the government should be engaged in it . the only way to find out is to leave other people free to <unk> <year> , friedman criticized social security in his book capitalism and freedom , arguing that it had created welfare <unk> . however , in the <unk> chapter of the same book , friedman argued that while capitalism had greatly reduced the extent of poverty in absolute terms , `` poverty is in part a relative matter , [ and ] even in [ wealthy western ] countries , there are clearly many people living under conditions that the rest of us label as poverty . '' friedman also noted that while private charity could be one <unk> for <unk> poverty and cited late <days> century britain and the united states as exemplary periods of extensive private charity and <unk> activity , he made the following point : it can be argued that private charity is <unk> because the benefits from it <unk> to people other than those who make the <unk> ... a neighborhood effect . i am <unk> by the sight of poverty ; i am benefited by its alleviation ; but i am benefited equally whether i or someone else pays for its alleviation ; the benefits of other people 's charity therefore partly <unk> to me . to put it differently , we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty , provided everyone else did . we might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance . in small communities , public pressure can <unk> to realize the <unk> even with private charity . in the large <unk> communities that are increasingly coming to <unk> our society , it is much more difficult for it to do so . suppose one <unk> , as i do , this line of reasoning as <unk> governmental action to alleviate poverty ; to set , as it were , a floor under the standard of life of every person in the community . [ while there are questions of how much should be spent and how , the ] arrangement that <unk> itself on purely mechanical grounds is a negative income tax . ... the advantages of this arrangement are clear . it is directed specifically at the problem of poverty . it gives help in the form most useful to the individual , namely , cash . it is general and could be <unk> for the host of special measures now in effect . it makes explicit the cost <unk> by society . it <unk> outside the market . like any other measures to alleviate poverty , it reduces the incentives of those helped to help themselves , but it does not eliminate that incentive entirely , as a system of <unk> incomes up to some fixed minimum would . an extra dollar earned always means more money available for expenditure . friedman argued further that other advantages of the negative income tax were that it could fit directly into the tax system , would be less costly , and would reduce the administrative burden of implementing a social safety net . friedman <unk> these arguments <integer> years later in free to choose , with the additional <unk> that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced the current system of welfare programs rather than <unk> it . according to economist robert h. frank , writing in the new york times , friedman 's views in this regard were grounded in a belief that while `` market forces ... accomplish wonderful things '' , they `` can not ensure a distribution of income that <unk> all citizens to meet basic economic needs '' .in <year> , friedman expressed support for <unk> in general in an interview on the phil <unk> show , saying `` the best way to [ deal with pollution ] is to impose a tax on the cost of the <unk> <unk> by a car and make an incentive for car manufacturers and for consumers to keep down the amount of pollution . '' in free to choose , friedman <unk> his support for <unk> as compared with increased environmental regulation , stating `` the preservation of the environment and the <unk> of <unk> pollution are real problems and they are problems concerning which the government has an important role to play . <unk> most economists agree that a far better way to control pollution than the present method of specific regulation and supervision is to introduce market discipline by imposing <unk> charges . `` in his <year> article `` the role of government in education '' friedman proposed <unk> publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of school vouchers . reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in , for example , chile in <year> and sweden in <year>. in <year> , friedman , together with his wife , founded the friedman foundation for educational choice to advocate school choice and vouchers . in <year> , the friedman foundation changed its name to <unk> to honor the <unk> ' desire to have the educational choice movement live on without their names attached to it after their <unk> walker of the fraser institute and friedman hosted a series of conferences from <year> to <year>. the goal was to create a clear definition of economic freedom and a method for measuring it . eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom , economic freedom in the world . this annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several <unk> sixteen other distinguished economists he opposed the copyright term extension act , and signed on to an <unk> brief filed in <unk> v. <unk> . friedman jokingly described it as a `` <unk> '' <unk> argued for stronger basic legal ( constitutional ) protection of economic rights and freedoms to further promote <unk> growth and prosperity and <unk> democracy and freedom and the rule of law generally in society . === social issues === friedman also supported libertarian policies such as legalization of drugs and <unk> . during <year> , friedman and more than <integer> other economists advocated discussions regarding the economic benefits of the legalization of <unk> was also a supporter of gay rights . he never specifically supported <unk> marriage , instead saying `` i do not believe there should be any discrimination against gays . `` friedman favored immigration , saying `` legal and illegal immigration has a very positive impact on the u.s . economy . '' however , he suggested that immigrants ought not to have access to the welfare system . friedman stated that immigration from mexico had been a `` good thing '' , in particular illegal immigration . friedman argued that illegal immigration was a <unk> because they `` take jobs that most residents of this country are <unk> to take , they provide employers with workers of a kind they can not get '' and they do not use welfare . in free to choose , friedman wrote : no arbitrary obstacles should prevent people from achieving those positions for which their talents fit them and which their values lead them to seek . not birth , nationality , color , religion , sex , nor any other irrelevant characteristic should determine the opportunities that are open to a person — only his <unk> also famously argued that the welfare state must end before immigration , or more specifically , before open borders , because immigrants might have an incentive to come directly because of welfare payments . economist bryan <unk> has disputed this assertion , arguing that welfare is generally distributed not among immigrants , but instead <unk> , through social <unk> was against public housing as he believed it was also a form of welfare . he believed the one of the main arguments that politicians have for public housing is that regular low income housing was too expensive due to the imposed higher cost of a fire and police department . he believed that it would only increase taxes and not benefit low income people in the long run . friedman was an advocate for direct cash instead of public housing believing that the people would be better off that way . he argued that liberals would never agree with this idea due to them not <unk> their own citizens . he also stated that regression has already happened with more land being left vacant due to slow construction . friedman argued that public housing instead <unk> juvenile <unk> was also against minimum wage laws , he saw them as a clear case as one can find that the precise opposite is happening when this was attempted . minimum wage laws would increase unemployment in his eyes and that employers would not hire back workers that were already there for less pay . in his view , this would leave low income people worse off because the voters for minimum wage laws would then become the victims of unemployment . he believed that these ideas of new minimum wage laws came from northern factories and unions , in an attempt to reduce competition from the south . == honors , recognition and legacy == george h. nash , a leading historian of american <unk> , says that by `` the end of the <year>s he was probably the most highly regarded and influential conservative scholar in the country , and one of the few with an international reputation . '' in <year> , friedman received the golden plate award of the american academy of achievement . friedman allowed the libertarian cato institute to use his name for its biennial milton friedman prize for advancing liberty beginning in <year>. a friedman prize was given to the late british economist peter bauer in <year> , <unk> economist <unk> de <unk> in <year> , <unk> laar , former estonian prime minister in <year> and a young venezuelan student <unk> <unk> in <year>. his wife rose , sister of aaron director , with whom he initiated the friedman foundation for educational choice , served on the international selection <unk> was also a recipient of the nobel memorial prize in <unk> friedman 's death , harvard president lawrence summers called him `` the great liberator '' , saying `` any honest democrat will admit that we are now all <unk> . '' he said friedman 's great popular contribution was `` in convincing people of the importance of allowing free markets to operate . `` stephen moore , a member of the editorial forward of the wall street journal , said in <year> : `` quoting the <unk> champion of <unk> economics since adam smith has become a little like quoting the bible . '' he adds , `` there are sometimes multiple and conflicting interpretations . `` although <unk> economist john kenneth galbraith was a prominent critic of friedman and his ideology , he <unk> that `` the age of john <month>nard keynes gave way to the age of milton friedman . '' === <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences === friedman won the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences , the sole recipient for <year> , `` for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis , monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy . '' his appointment was controversial , mainly for his association with military dictator <month>o pinochet . some economists , such as institutional economist and <year> nobel prize winner gunnar myrdal , criticized friedman , and myrdal 's own <year> nobel prize partner friedrich hayek , for being <unk> . myrdal 's criticism caused some economists to oppose the <unk> <unk> prize in economics sciences in memory of alfred nobel itself . === hong kong === friedman once said : `` if you want to see capitalism in action , go to hong kong . '' he wrote in <year> that the hong kong economy was perhaps the best example of a free market <unk> month before his death , he wrote `` hong kong <unk> would <unk> say ? '' in the wall street journal , criticizing donald tsang , chief executive of hong kong , for abandoning `` positive non <unk> . '' tsang later said he was merely changing the slogan to `` big market , small government '' , where small government is defined as less than <integer> % of gdp . in a debate between tsang and his rival alan <unk> before the <year> hong kong chief executive election , <unk> introduced the topic and jokingly accused tsang of <unk> friedman to death ( friedman had died only a year prior ) . === chile === during <year> , two years after the military coup that brought military dictator president <month>o pinochet to power and ended the government of salvador allende , the economy of chile experienced a severe crisis . friedman and arnold <unk> accepted an invitation of a private chilean foundation to visit chile and speak on principles of economic freedom . he spent seven days in chile giving a series of lectures at the universidad <unk> de chile and the ( national ) university of chile . one of the lectures was entitled `` the <unk> of freedom '' and according to friedman , `` dealt with precisely the threat to freedom from a centralized military government . `` in a letter to pinochet of <month> <integer> , <year> , friedman considered the `` key economic problems of chile are clearly ... inflation and the promotion of a healthy social market economy '' . he stated that `` there is only one way to end inflation : by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money '' and that `` cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable way to reduce the fiscal deficit , because it ... <unk> the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth '' . as to how rapidly inflation should be ended , friedman felt that `` for chile where inflation is <unk> at <unk> % a month ... <unk> is not feasible . it would involve so painful an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive . '' choosing `` a brief period of higher unemployment '' was the lesser evil .. and that `` the experience of germany , ... of brazil ... , of the post-war adjustment in the u.s. ... all argue for shock treatment '' . in the letter friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with `` a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve <unk> distress '' and `` for <unk> let me sketch the contents of a package proposal ... to be taken as <unk> '' although his knowledge of chile was `` too limited to <unk> [ him ] to be precise or comprehensive '' . he listed a `` sample proposal '' of <integer> monetary and fiscal measures including `` the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market . for example , <unk> ... the present law against <unk> employees '' . he closed , stating `` such a shock program could end inflation in months '' . his letter suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less <unk> unemployment than raising taxes . sergio de castro , a chilean chicago school graduate , became the nation 's minister of finance in <year>. during his six-year tenure , foreign investment increased , restrictions were placed on striking and labor unions , and gdp rose yearly . a foreign exchange program was created between the catholic university of chile and the university of chicago . many other chicago school alumni were appointed government posts during and after pinochet 's dictatorship ; others taught its economic doctrine at chilean universities . they became known as the chicago <unk> defended his activity in chile on the grounds that , in his opinion , the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of chile but also contributed to the <unk> of pinochet 's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during <year>. that idea is included in capitalism and freedom , in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom . in his <year> documentary free to choose , he said the following : `` chile is not a politically free system , and i do not <unk> the system . but the people there are freer than the people in communist societies because government plays a smaller role . ... the conditions of the people in the past few years has been getting better and not worse . they would be still better to get <unk> of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system . '' in <year> , friedman stated that he has `` never <unk> from criticizing the political system in chile . '' in <year> he said : `` i have nothing good to say about the political regime that pinochet imposed . it was a terrible political regime . the real miracle of chile is not how well it has done economically ; the real miracle of chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by <unk> believers in a free market . ... in chile , the drive for political freedom , that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success , ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy . now , at long last , chile has all three things : political freedom , human freedom and economic freedom . chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether , now that it has political freedom , that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom . '' he stressed that the lectures he gave in chile were the same lectures he later gave in china and other socialist states . he further stated `` i do not consider it as evil for an economist to <unk> technical economic advice to the chilean government , any more than i would regard it as evil for a physician to give technical medical advice to the chilean government to help end a medical plague . `` during the <year> pbs documentary the commanding heights ( based on the book ) , friedman continued to argue that `` free markets would <unk> [ pinochet 's ] political centralization and political control . `` , and that criticism over his role in chile missed his main contention that freer markets resulted in freer people , and that chile 's <unk> economy had caused pinochet 's rise . friedman advocated for free markets which <unk> `` political centralization and political control '' <unk> of his involvement with the government of chile , which was a dictatorship at the time of his visit , there were international protests , spanning from sweden to america when friedman was awarded the nobel memorial prize in <year>. friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in chile because of the relation of economists of the university of chicago to pinochet , and a <unk> trip he took to chile during <month> <year> ( less than two years after the coup that ended with the death of president salvador allende ) . friedman answered that he was never an advisor to the dictatorship , but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation , and met with officials , including <month>o pinochet the head of the military dictatorship , while in chile . after a <year> speech on drug legalization , friedman answered a question on his involvement with the pinochet regime , saying that he was never an advisor to pinochet ( also mentioned in his <year> iceland interview ) , but that a group university of chicago students were involved in chile 's economic reforms . friedman credited these reforms with high levels of economic growth and with the establishment of democracy that has subsequently occurred in chile . in <month> <year> , after returning from a lecture tour of china during which he had met with <unk> <unk> , general secretary of the communist party of china , friedman wrote to the stanford daily asking if he should <unk> a similar `` <unk> of protests for having been willing to give advice to so evil a government ? and if not , why not ? '' === iceland === friedman visited iceland during the autumn of <year> , met with important <unk> and gave a lecture at the university of iceland on the `` <unk> of the status quo . '' he participated in a <unk> television debate on <month> <integer> , <year> , with socialist intellectuals , including <unk> ragnar <unk> , who later became president of iceland . when they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the university and that , <unk> , lectures by visiting scholars had been <unk> , friedman replied that previous lectures had not been <unk> in a meaningful sense : lectures always have related costs . what mattered was whether <unk> or <unk> covered those costs . friedman thought that it was <unk> that only those who attended paid . in this discussion friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture . === estonia === although friedman never visited estonia , his book free to choose influenced estonia 's then <unk> prime minister , <unk> laar , who has claimed that it was the only book on economics he had read before taking office . laar 's reforms are often credited with responsibility for transforming estonia from an impoverished soviet republic to the `` baltic tiger . '' a prime element of laar 's program was introduction of the flat tax . laar won the <year> milton friedman prize for advancing liberty , awarded by the cato institute . === united kingdom === after <year> friedman was frequently invited to lecture in britain , and by the <year>s his ideas had gained widespread attention in conservative circles . for example , he was a regular speaker at the institute of economic affairs ( iea ) , a libertarian think tank . conservative politician margaret thatcher closely followed iea programs and ideas , and met friedman there in <year>. he also strongly influenced keith joseph , who became thatcher 's senior advisor on economic affairs , as well as alan <unk> and patrick <unk> , two other key advisers . major newspapers , including the daily telegraph , the times , and the financial times all <unk> friedman 's monetarist ideas to british decision-makers . friedman 's ideas strongly influenced thatcher and her allies when she became prime minister in <year> . === united states === after his death a number of obituaries and articles were written in friedman 's honor , citing him as one of the most important and influential economists of the post-war era . milton friedman 's somewhat controversial legacy in america remains strong within the conservative movement . however , some journalists and economists like <unk> smith and scott sumner have argued friedman 's academic legacy has been buried under his political philosophy and <unk> by modern conservatives . == criticism == econometrician david hendry criticized part of friedman 's and anna schwartz 's <year> monetary trends . when asked about it during an interview with <unk> tv in <year> , friedman said that the criticism referred to a different problem from that which he and schwartz had <unk> , and hence was irrelevant , and pointed out the lack of <unk> peer review amongst <unk> on hendry 's work . in <year> , hendry said that friedman was guilty of `` serious errors '' of misunderstanding that meant `` the <unk> he reported for uk money demand were <unk> by nearly <integer> per cent '' , and said that , in a paper published in <year> with neil ericsson , he had <unk> `` almost every empirical claim ... made about uk money demand '' by friedman and schwartz . a <year> paper updated and confirmed the validity of the <unk> findings through <year>. some commentators believe that friedman was not open enough , in their view , to the possibility of market <unk> . economist <unk> smith argues that while friedman made many important contributions to economic theory not all of his ideas relating to macroeconomics have entirely held up over the years and that too few people are willing to challenge <unk> scientist c.b . <unk> disagreed with friedman 's historical assessment of economic freedom leading to political freedom , suggesting that political freedom actually gave way to economic freedom for <unk> elites . he also challenged the notion that markets <unk> <unk> resources and rejected friedman 's definition of liberty . friedman 's <unk> methodological approach to economics has also been critiqued and debated . finnish economist <unk> <unk> argued some of his assumptions were unrealistic and <unk> chomsky suggested in his book profit over people that the primary role of what some describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational <unk> has been criticized by some prominent austrian economists , including murray rothbard and walter block . block called friedman a `` socialist '' , and was critical of his support for a central banking system , saying `` first and foremost , this economist supported the federal reserve system all throughout his professional life . that organization of course does not own the money stock , but controls it . friedman was an <unk> <unk> of the gold standard , <unk> its advocates as <unk> bugs ' . `` although the book was described by the cato institute as among the greatest economics books in the <days> century , and a monetary history of the united states is widely considered to be among the most influential economics books ever made , it has endured criticisms for its conclusion that the federal reserve was to blame for the great depression . some economists , including noted friedman critic peter <unk> have raised questions about the legitimacy of friedman 's claims about whether or not monetary quantity levels were endogenous rather than <unk> determined , as a monetary history of the united states posits . <unk> winning economist paul krugman argued that the <year> recession proved that , during a recession , a central bank can not control broad money ( <unk> money , as defined by the oecd ) , and even if it can , the money supply does not bear a direct or proven relationship with gdp . according to krugman , this was true in the <year>s , and the claim that the federal reserve could have avoided the great depression by reacting to what friedman called the great contraction is `` highly dubious '' <unk> tobin questioned the importance of velocity of money , and how <unk> this measure of the frequency of transactions is to understanding the various fluctuations observed in a monetary history of the united <unk> historian barry <unk> argued that because of the gold standard , which was at this point in time the chief monetary system of the world , the federal reserve 's hands were tied . this was because , in order to retain the credibility of the gold standard , the federal reserve could not undertake actions like dramatically expanding the money supply as proposed by friedman and <unk> economist murray rothbard criticized friedman 's conclusions , and argued they are inconsistent with data , because during the period described by friedman as `` the great contraction , '' the money supply increased . friedman and schwartz argued that the great depression happened as a result of a <unk> spiral which , according to rothbard , is inconsistent with <unk> <unk> , distinguished fellow of the economic policy institute , argues that wages have been kept low in the united states because of the friedman doctrine , namely the adoption of corporate practices and economic policies ( or the <unk> of reforms ) at the behest of business and the wealthy elite , which resulted in the systematic <unk> of workers . he argues that the lack of worker power caused wage suppression , increased wage inequality , and <unk> racial <unk> . notably , mechanisms such as excessive unemployment , globalization , <unk> labor standards ( and their lack of enforcement ) , weakened collective bargaining , and corporate structure changes that <unk> workers , all collectively functioned to keep wages low . from <year> to <year> , while <unk> productivity rose almost <integer> percent , <unk> <unk> for typical workers increased less than <integer> percent ,

spending the majority of her career at a biophysics research unit at king 's college london , where she was a founder member , and later its second head . while working at massachusetts institute of technology , she , with hugh huxley , discovered the mechanism of movement of muscle fibre in <year> , which came to known as `` sliding <unk> theory '' . this was a groundbreaking research in muscle physiology , and for this bbc nicknamed her `` mrs muscle '' on the <days> anniversary of the discovery . == early life == hanson was born on <integer> <month> <year> in <unk> , <unk> , england , the only child of tom and emily hanson . her parents were both school teachers . she was raised solely by her mother after her father died of a brain <unk> soon after her birth . through her mother 's

<integer> <month> <year> – <integer> <month> <year> ) was a <unk> biologist and writer , whose works on graft rejection and the discovery of acquired <unk> tolerance were fundamental to the medical practice of tissue and organ transplants . for his scientific works he is regarded as the `` father of transplantation '' . he is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings . famous zoologists such as richard dawkins referred to him as `` the <unk> of all scientific writers '' , and stephen jay gould as `` the <unk> man i have ever known '' .medawar was the youngest child of a lebanese father and a british mother , and was both a brazilian and british citizen by birth . he studied at marlborough college and magdalen college , oxford , and was professor of zoology at the university of birmingham and university college london . until he was partially disabled by a cerebral <unk> , he was director of the national institute for medical research at mill hill . with his doctoral student leslie brent and postdoctoral fellow rupert e. billingham , he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance ( the phenomenon of <unk> of the <unk> system to certain molecules ) , which was <unk> predicted by sir frank macfarlane burnet . this became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation . he and burnet shared the <year> nobel prize in physiology or medicine `` for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance '' . == early life and education == medawar was born in <unk> , a town <integer> miles north of rio de janeiro , brazil , where his parents were living . he was the third child of lebanese nicholas <unk> medawar , born in the village of <unk> , north of <unk> , lebanon , and british mother edith <unk> ( née <unk> ) . he had a brother philip and a sister pamela . ( pamela was later married to sir david hunt , who served as private secretary to prime ministers clement attlee and winston churchill . ) his father , a christian <unk> , became a <unk> british citizen and worked for a british dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to brazil as an agent . ( he later described his father 's profession as selling `` false <unk> in south america '' . ) his status as a british citizen was acquired at birth , as he said , `` my birth was registered at the british <unk> in good time to acquire the status of <unk> british subject ' . `` medawar left brazil with his family for england `` towards the end of the war '' , and he lived there for the rest of his life . he was also a brazilian citizen by birth , as <unk> by the brazilian nationality law ( <unk> <unk> ) . at <integer> years , when he was of age to be drafted in the brazilian army , he applied for <unk> of military conscription to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , his godfather and the then minister of aviation . his application was denied by general <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he had to <unk> his brazilian <unk> <year> , medawar went to marlborough college in marlborough , wiltshire . he hated the college because `` they were critical and <unk> at the same time , <unk> what kind of person a lebanese <unk> foreign you can be sure '' . and also because of its preference on sports , in which he was weak . an experience of <unk> and racism made him feel the rest of his life `` <unk> and <unk> at the <unk> and <unk> of [ marlborough 's ] essentially <unk> institution , '' and likened it to the training schools for the nazi ss as all `` founded upon the twin pillars of sex and <unk> . '' his proudest moments at the college were with his teacher <unk> gordon lowndes , to whom he credited the beginning of his career in biology . he recognised lowndes as barely <unk> but `` a very , very good biology teacher '' . lowndes had taught eminent biologists including john z. young and richard julius <unk> . yet medawar was inherently weak in <unk> and was constantly <unk> by their <unk> : `` bloody <unk> is the boy whose drawing of his <unk> <unk> in any way <unk> from the diagram in the textbook . `` in <year> , he went on to magdalen college , oxford , graduating with a first-class honours degree in zoology in <year>. medawar was appointed christopher welch scholar and senior <unk> of magdalen in <year>. he also worked at the sir william <unk> school of pathology supervised by howard florey ( later nobel laureate , and who inspired him to take up immunology ) and completed his doctoral thesis in <year>. in <year> , he became fellow of magdalen through an examination , the position he held till <year>. it was there that he started working with j. z. young on the regeneration of nerves . his invention of a nerve <unk> proved useful in surgical operations of severed nerves during the world war <unk> university of oxford approved his doctor of philosophy thesis titled `` growth promoting and growth <unk> factors in normal and <unk> development '' in <year> , but because of the <unk> cost of <unk> ( the process by which the degree is officially conferred ) , he spent the money on his urgent <unk> instead . the university of oxford later awarded him a doctor of science degree in <year> . == career and research == after completing his phd , medawar was appointed a <unk> <unk> in <year> , senior research fellow of st john 's college , oxford , in <year> , and a university demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy , also in <year>. he was re-elected fellow of magdalen from <year> to <year>. in <year> , he became mason professor of zoology at the university of birmingham and worked there till <year>. he transferred to the university college london in <year> as <unk> professor of zoology and comparative <unk> <year> , he was appointed director of the national institute for medical research . his predecessor sir charles <unk> was an able administrator such that taking over his post was , as he described , `` [ n ] o more <unk> than ... sliding over into the <unk> of a <unk> '' . he was head of the transplantation section of the medical research council 's clinical research centre at harrow from <year> to <year>. he became professor of experimental medicine at the royal institution ( <year>–1983 ) , and president of the royal postgraduate medical school ( <year>–1987 ) . === immunology === medawar 's first scientific research was on the effect of <unk> on the development of <unk> tissue cells ( <unk> ) in <unk> . reading the draft of the manuscript , howard florey commented that it was more philosophical than scientific . it was published in the quarterly journal of experimental physiology in <unk> 's involvement with what became transplant research began during world war ii , when he investigated possible improvements in skin <unk> . his first publication on the subject was `` sheets of pure <unk> <unk> from human skin '' , which was published in nature in <year>. his studies particularly concerned solution for skin wounds among soldiers in the war . in <year> , he moved to the university of birmingham , taking along with him his phd student leslie brent and postdoctoral fellow rupert billingham . his research became more focused in <year> , when australian biologist frank macfarlane burnet , at the walter and <unk> hall institute of medical research in melbourne , advanced the hypothesis that during embryonic life and immediately after birth , cells gradually acquire the ability to distinguish between their own tissue <unk> on the one hand and <unk> cells and foreign material on the <unk> billingham , he published a seminal paper in <year> on grafting technique . santa j. <unk> , the american <unk> , has described the enduring impact of this paper to modern science . based on this technique of grafting , medawar 's team devised a method to test burnet 's hypothesis . they <unk> cells from young mouse embryos and <unk> them into another mouse of different <unk> . when the mouse developed into adult and skin grafting from that of the original strain was performed , there was no tissue rejection . meaning that the mouse had tolerated the foreign tissue , which would normally be rejected . their experimental proof of burnet 's hypothesis was first published in a brief article in nature in <year> , followed by a series of papers , and a comprehensive description in philosophical transactions of the royal society b in <year> , giving the name `` actively acquired tolerance '' . ==== research outcomes ==== medawar was awarded his nobel prize in <year> with burnet for their work in tissue grafting which is the basis of organ transplants , and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance . this work was used in dealing with skin <unk> required after burns . medawar 's work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of immunology from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself , as in the attempt to suppress the body 's rejection of organ transplants . it directly laid the foundation for the first successful organ transplantation in humans , specifically kidney transplantation , carried out by an american physician joseph murray , who eventually received the <year> nobel prize in physiology or medicine . === theory of senescence === medawar 's <year> lecture an <unk> problem of biology ( published <year> ) addressed ageing and senescence , and he begins by defining both terms as follows : we obviously need a word for mere ageing , and i propose to use <unk> ' itself for just that purpose . <unk> ' <unk> stands for mere ageing , and has no other <unk> . i shall use the word <unk> ' to mean ageing accompanied by that decline of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and energies which ageing <unk> <unk> . he then <unk> the question of why evolution has permitted organisms to <unk> , even though ( <integer> ) senescence <unk> individual fitness , and ( <integer> ) there is no obvious necessity for senescence . in answering this question , medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights . first , there is an <unk> decline in probability of an organism 's existence , and , therefore , in what he terms `` reproductive value . '' he suggests that it therefore follows that the force of natural selection <unk> <unk> with age late in life ( because the <unk> of younger <unk> is <unk> more significant in producing the next generation ) . what happens to an organism after reproduction is only <unk> reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives . he pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life , as judged by life tables , was an indirect measure of fitness , that is , the capacity of an organism to propagate its genes . life tables for humans show , for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age <integer> , which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction . this has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the evolution of senescence . === theory on endocrine evolution === medawar presented a talk on <unk> in animals ( the phenomenon by which some animals give live birth ) at a meeting on evolution at oxford in <month> <year>. later published in <year> , he introduced an <unk> : endocrine evolution is not an evolution of hormones but an evolution of the uses to which they are put ; an evolution not , to put it <unk> , of chemical <unk> but of <unk> , reaction patterns and tissue <unk> notion that evolution and diversity of endocrine function in animals are due to different uses of each hormone rather than different hormones themselves became an established fact . the paper is also regarded as a pioneer in the field of reproductive immunology . == personal life == medawar never knew the exact meaning of his surname , an arabic word , he was told , for `` to make round '' ; but which a friend explained to him as `` little round fat man '' .medawar married jean <unk> taylor on <integer> <month> <year>. they met while in graduate class at oxford , he at magdalene and taylor at <unk> college . taylor approached him for the meaning of `` heuristic '' , which she had to ask twice , and he had to finally offer lessons in philosophy . medawar described her as `` the most beautiful woman in oxford '' ; but taylor 's impression was he looked `` <unk> <unk> . '' taylor 's family objected to their marriage as medawar had `` no background , and no money . '' her mother was explicitly afraid of having `` black '' grandchildren ; her aunt <unk> her . the couple had two sons , charles and alexander , and two daughters , caroline and louise . medawar was interested in a wide range of subjects including opera , philosophy and cricket . he was exceptionally tall , <integer> ft and <integer> <unk> , physically robust , with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures . he was renowned for wit and humour , which he claimed he inherited from his `` <unk> '' mother . as he completed his phd research in <year> , he did not receive the degree as he could not afford the <unk> <unk> , to which he commented : i 'm an <unk> . i am a doctor , but not a phd ... morally i 'm a phd , in the sense i could have had one if i 'd been able to afford it . <unk> it was <unk> in my day . john young [ probably referring to john <unk> young ] was not a phd either . a phd was regarded then as a <unk> german <unk> , as <unk> and undesirable as having german <unk> playing on <unk> . '' he was regarded as the philosopher karl popper 's best-known <unk> in <unk> was the maternal grandfather of the <unk> and director alex <unk> . === views on religion === medawar declared : ... i believe that a reasonable case can be made for saying , not that we believe in god because he exists but rather that he exists because we believe in him ... considered as an element of the world , god has the same degree and kind of objective reality as do other products of mind ... i regret my <unk> in god and religious answers generally , for i believe it would give satisfaction and comfort to many in need of it if it were possible to discover and <unk> good scientific and <unk> reasons to believe in god ... to <unk> from the rule of reason and substitute for it an <unk> of belief by the <unk> and degree of conviction with which we hold it can be perilous and destructive ... i am a <unk> of a period piece <unk> , i admit ... although he normally <unk> with christianity especially on moral teachings , he found the biblical stories <unk> and was `` shocked by the way in which [ biblical ] characters <unk> and <unk> each other . '' he even asked his wife `` to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [ their ] children . '' nonetheless , he also said the following , which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate , it does not help them all equally : religion has not sustained me on any of the occasions when the comfort it <unk> would have been most welcome . == later life and death == in <year> medawar was invited by the bbc to present the broadcaster 's annual <unk> <unk> in the footsteps of his colleague , j. z. young , who was <unk> lecturer in <year>. for his own series of six radio broadcasts , titled the future of man , medawar examined how the human race might continue to evolve . while attending the annual british association meeting in <year> , medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at exeter cathedral , a duty which falls on every new president of the british association . it was , as he said , `` <unk> bad luck because jim whyte black had not yet devised <unk> , which slow the <unk> and could have preserved my health and my career '' . medawar 's failing health <month> have had repercussions for medical science and the relations between the scientific community and government . before the stroke , medawar was one of britain 's most influential scientists , especially in the biomedical field . after the <unk> of his speech and movement , medawar , with his wife 's help , <unk> his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale . however , more <unk> followed and in <year> he died in the royal free hospital , london . he is interred with his wife jean ( <year>–2005 ) in the <unk> of st andrew 's church in <unk> in east sussex . == awards and honours == medawar was elected a fellow of the royal society ( frs ) in <year>. with frank macfarlane burnet he shared the <year> nobel prize in physiology or medicine `` for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance '' . the british government conferred him a cbe in <year> , knighted him in <year> , and appointed him to the order of the

named after him : the royal society created the medawar lecture in <year> in a subject relating to the history of science , philosophy of science or the social function of science . since <year> , the lecture has been merged with two older ones <unk> john <unk> and john desmond <unk> , and became <unk> lecture and the accompanying award , <unk> medal . medawar medal , awarded by the british

awarded the <year> nobel memorial prize in economic sciences with james <unk> for their research into the economic theory of incentives under <unk> information , becoming the only nobel laureate born in british columbia . the announcement of his nobel prize was made just three days prior to his death . vickrey died while traveling to a conference of georgist academics that he helped found and

vickrey was the first to use the tools of game theory to explain the dynamics of auctions . in his seminal paper , vickrey derived several auction equilibria , and provided an early <unk> result . the revenue equivalence theorem remains the <unk> of modern auction theory . the vickrey auction is named after <unk> worked on congestion pricing , the notion that roads and other services should be <unk> so that users see the costs that <unk> from the service being fully used when there is still demand . congestion pricing gives a signal to users to <unk> their behavior or to investors to expand the service in order to remove the <unk> . the theory was later partially put into action in london . in public economics , vickrey extended the georgist marginal cost pricing approach of harold hotelling and showed how public goods should be provided at marginal cost and capital investment <unk> financed with land value tax . vickrey wrote that replacing taxes on production and labor ( `` including property taxes on improvements '' ) with <unk> for holding valuable land sites `` would substantially improve the economic efficiency of the <unk> '' . vickrey further argued that land value tax had no <unk> effects and that replacing existing taxes in this way would increase local productivity enough that land prices would rise instead of fall . he also made an ethical argument for georgist value capture , noting that owners of valuable locations still take ( <unk> others from ) local public goods , even if they choose not to use them , so without land value tax , land users have to pay twice for those public services ( once in tax to government and once in rent to holders of land title ) <unk> 's economic philosophy was influenced by john <month>nard keynes and henry george . he was sharply critical of the chicago school of economics and was vocal in opposing the political focus on achieving balanced budgets and fighting inflation , especially in times of high

that it appears that singer wrote down the thesis before the more well-known prebisch . the fundamental claim of the hypothesis is that in a world system in which poorer nations <unk> in primary products such as raw <unk> and agricultural products that are then <unk> to <unk> nations that , in turn , make advanced products to be sold to poorer nations , all of the benefits of international trade go to the wealthy nations . as a result , singer was a passionate advocate for increased foreign aid in a variety of forms to the developing world to <unk> the <unk> gain to developed nations of

vietnam escalated dramatically . mcnamara and other us policymakers feared that the fall of south vietnam to a communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region . in <month> <year> , he launched project <other>00,000 , the lowering of army <unk> standards which allowed <unk> additional men to be recruited , despite criticism that they were not <unk> to working in high stress or dangerous environments . mcnamara grew increasingly skeptical of the efficacy of committing american troops to vietnam . in <year> , he resigned as secretary of defense to become president of the world bank . he remains the longest serving secretary of defense , having remained in office over seven years . he served as president of the world bank until <year> , shifting the focus of the world bank from infrastructure and industrialization towards poverty reduction . after retiring , he served as a trustee of several organizations , including the california institute of technology and the brookings institution . in his later writings and interviews , he expressed regret for the decisions he made during the vietnam war . == early life and career == robert mcnamara was born in san francisco , california . his father was robert james mcnamara , sales manager of a <unk> shoe company , and his mother was clara <unk> ( strange ) mcnamara . his father 's family was irish and , in about <year> , following the great irish famine , had emigrated to the u.s. , first to massachusetts and later to california . he graduated from piedmont high school in piedmont , california in <year> , where he was president of the <unk> <unk> boys club and earned the rank of eagle scout . mcnamara attended the university of california , berkeley and graduated in <year> with a b.a . in economics with <unk> in mathematics and philosophy . he was a member of the phi <unk> delta fraternity , was elected to phi beta kappa in his <unk> year , and earned a <unk> letter in crew . before <unk> into the army air force , mcnamara was a cadet in the golden bear battalion at <unk> . berkeley . mcnamara was also a member of the uc berkeley 's order of the golden bear , a fellowship of students and leading faculty members formed to promote leadership within the student body . he then attended harvard business school , where he earned an <unk> in <year> . immediately thereafter , mcnamara worked a year at price <unk> , a san francisco accounting firm . he returned to harvard in <month> <year> to teach accounting in the business school and became the institution 's <unk> and youngest assistant professor at that time . following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the united states army air forces , he entered the <unk> as a captain in early <year> , serving most of world war ii with its office of statistical control . one of his major responsibilities was the analysis of u.s. bombers ' efficiency and effectiveness , especially the <unk> forces commanded by major general curtis le<month> in india , china , and the mariana islands . mcnamara established a statistical control unit for the <unk> bomber command and devised schedules for <unk> <unk> as <unk> for carrying fuel and cargo over the <unk> . he left active duty in <year> with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a legion of merit . == ford motor company == in <year> , <unk> thornton , a colonel under whom mcnamara had served , put together a group of former officers from the office of statistical control to go into business together . thornton had seen an article in life magazine portraying ford as being in <unk> need of reform . henry ford ii , himself a world war ii veteran from the navy , hired the entire group of ten , including mcnamara . the `` whiz kids '' , as they came to be known , helped the <unk> company reform its chaotic administration through modern planning , organization , and management control systems . because of their youth , combined with asking many questions , ford employees initially and <unk> referred to them as the `` quiz kids '' . the quiz kids <unk> themselves as the `` whiz kids '' . starting as manager of planning and financial analysis , mcnamara advanced rapidly through a series of <unk> management positions . mcnamara had ford adopt computers to construct models to find the most efficient , rational means of production , which led to much <unk> . mcnamara 's style of `` scientific management '' with his use of computer <unk> featuring graphs showing trends in the auto industry were regarded as extremely innovative in the <year>s and were much <unk> by other executives in the following decades . in his <year> memoirs , mcnamara wrote : `` i had spent fifteen years as a manager [ at ford ] identifying problems and forcing <unk> against their <unk> think deeply and <unk> about alternative courses of action and their consequences '' . he was a force behind the ford falcon <unk> , introduced in the fall of <unk> small , simple and <unk> counter to the large , expensive vehicles prominent in the late <year>s . mcnamara placed a high emphasis on safety : the <unk> options package introduced the seat <unk> ( a <unk> at the time ) and a <unk> steering <unk> , which helped to prevent the <unk> from being <unk> on the steering column during a <unk> the lincoln line 's very large <year> , <year> , and <year> models proved unpopular , mcnamara pushed for smaller versions , such as the <year> lincoln continental . on <month> <integer> , <year> , mcnamara became the first president of ford motor company from outside the ford family since john s. <unk> in <year> . == secretary of defense == after his election in <year> , <unk> john f. kennedy first offered the post of secretary of defense to robert a. <unk> , who had already served in that position in the truman administration ; <unk> declined but recommended mcnamara . kennedy had read about mcnamara and his career in a time magazine article on <month> <integer> , <year> , and interviewed him on <month> <integer> , with his brother and <unk> man robert f. kennedy also being present . mcnamara told kennedy that he did n't know anything about government , to which kennedy replied : `` we can learn our jobs together . i do n't know how to be president either '' . mcnamara had read kennedy 's <unk> book profiles in courage and asked him if he had really written it himself , with kennedy <unk> that he did . mcnamara 's confidence and <unk> impressed kennedy . kennedy offered mcnamara the chance to be either secretary of defense or secretary of the treasury ; mcnamara came back a week later , accepting the post of secretary of defense on the condition of having the right of final approval in all appointments to the department of defense , with kennedy <unk> : `` it 's a deal '' . mcnamara 's salary as the ceo of ford ran to some $ <integer> million dollars per year while by contrast the position of the defense secretary paid only $ <other>5,000 per year . given the financial sacrifices , mcnamara was able to <unk> to kennedy that he have the right to appoint his officials and run the pentagon his own way . according to special counsel ted <unk> , kennedy regarded mcnamara as the `` star of his team , calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security , including business and economic matters . '' mcnamara became one of the few members of the kennedy administration to work and <unk> with kennedy , and he became close to attorney general robert f. kennedy , eventually serving as a <unk> at the younger kennedy 's funeral in <year> . initially , the basic policies outlined by president kennedy in a message to congress on <month> <integer> , <year> , guided mcnamara in the <unk> of the defense program . kennedy rejected the concept of <unk> attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the united states and its allies . u.s. arms , he maintained , must constantly be under civilian command and control , and the nation 's defense posture had to be `` designed to reduce the danger of irrational or <unk> general war . '' the primary mission of u.s. overseas forces , in cooperation with its allies , was `` to prevent the steady <unk> of the free world through limited wars '' . kennedy and mcnamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response . the u.s. wanted choices in an emergency other than `` <unk> <unk> or unlimited retaliation '' , as the president put it . out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the u.s. initiated by mcnamara in <year> came a decision to increase the nation 's `` limited warfare '' capabilities . these moves were significant because mcnamara was abandoning president dwight d. eisenhower 's policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased u.s. capacity to conduct limited , <unk> warfare . the kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving the ability to counter communist `` wars of national liberation '' , in which the enemy avoided <unk> military confrontation and <unk> to political <unk> and guerrilla tactics . as mcnamara said in his <year> annual report , `` the military tactics are those of the <unk> , the <unk> , and the raid . the political tactics are terror , extortion , and assassination . '' in practical terms , this meant training and <unk> u.s. military personnel , as well as allies such as south vietnam , for counterinsurgency operations . during the cuban missile crisis in <month> <year> , mcnamara served as a member of excomm and played a large role in the administration 's handling and eventual <unk> of the cuban missile crisis . he was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the joint chiefs of staff to agree with the blockade option . increased attention to conventional strength <unk> these special forces <unk> . in this instance , he called up reserves and also proceeded to expand the regular armed forces . whereas active duty strength had declined from approximately <unk> to <unk> between <year> ( the end of the korean war ) and <year> , it increased to nearly <unk> by <month> <integer> , <year>. then the forces <unk> off at around <unk> until the vietnam military buildup began in <year> , reaching a peak of nearly <unk> by <unk> , just after mcnamara left office . kennedy , who was fascinated with counterinsurgency warfare , made a major push to develop the special forces , popularly known as the green <unk> . the u.s. army leadership was , for the most part , strongly opposed to the counterinsurgency <unk> , and stoutly <unk> the presidential pressure for more counterinsurgency training and forces . the u.s. army , for reasons of bureaucratic politics , <unk> reasons and <unk> pride , wanted to be <unk> to fight a conventional war in central europe against the soviet army , with a large number of divisions armed with expensive <unk> weapons designed for maximum firepower , instead of having small teams of special forces armed with relatively low tech weapons like assault rifles fight in a third world country . === nuclear strategy , the <unk> doctrine === when mcnamara took over the pentagon in <year> , the united states military relied on an <unk> nuclear strike to respond to a soviet attack of any kind , which would kill soviet military forces and civilians . this was the same nuclear strategy planned by the strategic air command ( <unk> ) , led by general curtis le<month> . mcnamara did not agree with this approach . he sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all soviet nuclear weapons , thus leaving the united states vulnerable to retaliation . mcnamara 's alternative in the doctrine of <unk> was to try to limit the united states nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces . this would prevent retaliation and escalation by holding soviet cities hostage to a follow-up strike . mcnamara later concluded that <unk> was not likely to control escalation but to <unk> retaliation . the u.s. nuclear policy remained the same . === other steps === mcnamara took other steps to increase u.s. deterrence posture and military capabilities . he raised the proportion of strategic air command ( <unk> ) strategic bombers on <unk> ground <unk> from <integer> % to <integer> % , thus <unk> their <unk> to missile attack . in <month> <year> , he established the united states strike command ( <unk> ) . authorized to draw forces when needed from the strategic army corps ( <unk> ) , the tactical air command , and the airlift units of the military air transport service and the military services , strike command had the mission `` to respond <unk> and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world , <unk> unified <unk> or ... carrying out separate <unk> operations . '' mcnamara also increased long-range airlift and <unk> capabilities and funds for space research and development . after reviewing the separate and often <unk> service efforts in intelligence and communications , mcnamara in <year> consolidated these functions in the defense intelligence agency and the defense communications agency ( the latter originally established by <unk> robert <unk> in <year> ) , having both report to the secretary of defense through the jcs . the end effect was to remove the intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it under the control of the secretary of defense . in the same year , he set up the defense supply agency to work toward unified supply procurement , distribution , and inventory management under the control of the secretary of defense rather than the <unk> military . mcnamara 's institution of systems analysis as a basis for making key decisions on force requirements , weapon systems , and other matters <unk> much debate . two of its main practitioners during the mcnamara era , alain c. enthoven and k. wayne smith , described the concept as follows : `` first , the word <unk> ' indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary ... the word <unk> ' <unk> the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding . systems analysis takes a complex problem and <unk> out the <unk> of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it . '' enthoven and smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning . mcnamara 's tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his <unk> with service leaders . it was also generally thought that systems analysis , rather than being objective , was <unk> by the civilians to support decisions that mcnamara had already made . the most notable example of systems analysis was the planning , programming and <unk> system ( ppbs ) instituted by united states department of defense <unk> charles j. <unk> . mcnamara directed <unk> to analyze defense requirements systematically and produce a long-term , <unk> defense budget . ppbs evolved to become the heart of the mcnamara management program . according to enthoven and smith , the basic ideas of ppbs were : `` the attempt to put defense program issues into a broader context and to search for explicit measures of national need and adequacy '' ; `` consideration of military needs and costs together '' ; `` explicit consideration of alternatives at the top decision level '' ; `` the active use of an analytical staff at the top <unk> levels '' ; `` a plan combining both forces and costs which projected into the future the <unk> implications of current decisions '' ; and `` open and explicit analysis , that is , each analysis should be made available to all interested parties , so that they can examine the calculations , data , and assumptions and <unk> the steps leading to the conclusions . '' in practice , the data produced by the analysis was so large and so complex that while it was available to all interested parties , none of them could challenge the <unk> the management tools developed to implement ppbs were the five year defense plan ( fydp ) , the draft presidential memorandum ( dpm ) , the readiness , information and control tables , and the development concept paper ( <unk> ) . the annual fydp was a series of tables <unk> forces for eight years and costs and <unk> for five years in <unk> , rather than individual service , programs . by <year> , the fydp covered ten military areas : strategic forces , <unk> forces , intelligence and communications , airlift and <unk> , guard and reserve forces , research and development , central supply and <unk> , training and medical services , administration and related activities , and support of other nations . the draft presidential memorandum ( dpm ) <unk> for the white house and usually prepared by the systems analysis <unk> a method to study and analyze major defense issues . sixteen dpms appeared between <year> and <year> on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces , nato strategy and force structure , military assistance , and tactical air forces . <unk> sent the dpms to the services and the joint chief of staff ( jcs ) for comment ; in making decisions , mcnamara included in the dpm a statement of alternative approaches , force levels , and other factors . the dpm in its final form became a decision document . the dpm was hated by the jcs and <unk> military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the white house . the dpms were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its <unk> development concept paper examined performance , schedule , cost estimates , and technical risks to provide a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program . but in practice , what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military . it aided the trend toward a few large <unk> defense contractors serving the military . rather than serving any useful purpose , the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the <unk> readiness , information , and control tables provided data on specific projects , more detailed than in the fydp , such as the tables for the southeast asia deployment plan , which recorded by month and <unk> the schedule for deployment , consumption rates , and future <unk> of u.s. forces in southeast asia . === cuban missile crisis === the cuban missile crisis was between the united states and the soviet union lasting for <integer> days in <month> <year>. during this time , robert mcnamara was serving as secretary of defense and one of john f. kennedy 's <unk> advisors . when kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive soviet missiles in cuba , he immediately set up <unk> committee ' , referred to as <unk> ' . this committee included united states government officials , including robert mcnamara , to advise kennedy on the crisis . kennedy instructed excomm to immediately come up with a response to the soviet threat unanimously without him present . the joint chiefs of staff favored launching air strikes against the soviet missile sites in cuba , an opinion that mcnamara did not hold and advised kennedy against the chiefs , warning that air strikes would almost certainly be crossing the <unk> . mcnamara 's relations with the hawkish joint chiefs of staff had been <unk> during the crisis , and his relations with admiral george anderson and general curtis le<month> were especially <unk> . both admiral anderson and general le<month> had favored invading cuba , welcomed the prospect of a war with soviet union under the grounds that a war with the soviet union was inevitable , and whose attitudes towards kennedy and mcnamara had <unk> on <unk> . admiral anderson had at a one point ordered mcnamara out of the naval operations room , saying that as a civilian he was <unk> to be making decisions about naval matters , leading mcnamara to say that he was the defense secretary and anderson was <unk> to be ordering him to do anything . during this time it was confirmed the crisis had to be resolved within <integer> hours by receiving two messages from nikita khrushchev . the first message , an informal one , stated if the united states guaranteed to not invade cuba then they would take the missiles out . the second message , a more formal one , was broadcast on the radio stating if the united states attacked then cuba was prepared to <unk> with masses of military power . although american defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons , kennedy and mcnamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be <unk> . on <dayofweek> <month> <integer> , excomm had their first meeting . the majority of officials favored an air attack on cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites , although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives . by the end of the week , excomm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president : a blockade , an air strike , an invasion , or some combination of these . these actions are known as oplan <integer> , oplan <integer> and oplan <decimal> a quarantine was a way to prevent the soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of cuba . during the final review of both alternatives on <dayofweek> , <month> <integer> , upon kennedy 's request , mcnamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine . on <dayofweek> , <month> <integer> at <unk> a.m. <unk> , the quarantine line around cuba went into effect . following cuba 's aftermath , mcnamara stated , `` there is no such thing as strategy , only crisis management . `` after the crisis mcnamara recommended to kennedy that admiral anderson and general le<month> be sacked . however , kennedy was afraid of a congressional backlash if he sacked two of the chiefs at once . moreover , kennedy did not wish for his disagreements with the joint chiefs to become public and felt that sacking two of the chiefs at once would lead to speculation in the media about such a disagreement . kennedy told mcnamara : `` all right , you can fire one . which one will it be ? '' without <unk> , mcnamara answered `` anderson '' . later on in <year> , a white house release announced that admiral anderson was the new american ambassador to portugal . === cost reductions === mcnamara 's staff stressed systems analysis as an aid in decision making on weapon development and many other budget issues . the secretary believed that the united states could afford any amount needed for national security , but that `` this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars .... you have to make a judgment on how much is enough . '' acting on these principles , mcnamara instituted a <unk> cost reduction program , which , he reported , saved $ <integer> billion in the five-year period beginning in <year>. although he had to <unk> a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts , he closed many military bases and <unk> that he judged unnecessary for national security . he was equally determined about other <unk> <unk> to the nuclear arms race , the vietnam war buildup and other projects , total <unk> authority ( <unk> ) increased greatly during the mcnamara years . fiscal year <unk> increased from $ <decimal> billion in <year> ( equal to $ <integer> billion in <year> ) to $ <decimal> ( $ <integer> ) billion in <year> ( before the major vietnam increases ) to $ <decimal> ( $ <integer> ) billion in <year> , mcnamara 's last year in office ( though he left office in <month> ) . not until <unk> <year> did <unk> 's total <unk> authority surpass that of <unk> <year> in constant dollars . ==== program consolidation ==== one major <unk> of mcnamara 's cost reductions was the consolidation of programs from different services , most visibly in aircraft acquisition , believing that the <unk> created waste and unnecessary spending . mcnamara directed the air force to adopt the navy 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> combat aircraft , a consolidation that was quite successful . conversely , his actions in <unk> a <unk> <unk> adoption of the <unk> <unk> rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat , though later congressional investigations revealed the causes of these failures as <unk> and <unk> sabotage on behalf of the army ordnance corps ' officers . mcnamara tried to extend his success by <unk> development programs as well , resulting in the tfx dual service project to combine navy requirements for a fleet air defense ( <unk> ) aircraft and air force requirements for a tactical bomber . his experience in the corporate world led him to believe that <unk> a single type for different missions and service would save money . he insisted on the general dynamics entry over the <unk> 's preference for <unk> because of <unk> issues . though <unk> as a fighter that could do everything ( fast supersonic dash , slow carrier and short airfield landings , tactical strike and even close air support ) , in the end it involved too many <unk> to succeed at any of them . the navy version was drastically <unk> and difficult to land , and eventually <unk> after a grumman study showed it was <unk> of <unk> the abilities of the newly revealed soviet <unk> and <unk> aircraft . the <unk> would eventually find its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the air <unk> , many analysts believe that even though the tfx project itself was a failure , mcnamara was ahead of his time as the trend in fighter design has continued toward consolidation — the <unk> falcon and <unk> <unk> emerged as <unk> fighters , and most modern designs combine many of the roles the tfx would have had . in many ways , the joint strike fighter is seen as a rebirth of the tfx project , in that it <unk> to satisfy the needs of three american air arms ( as well as several foreign customers ) , fulfilling the roles of strike fighter , <unk> fighter , <unk> , and close air support ( and drawing many criticisms similar to those <unk> against the tfx ) . === vietnam war === ==== into vietnam ==== during president john f. kennedy 's term , while mcnamara was secretary of defense , america 's troops in south vietnam increased from <integer> to <unk> advisers , who were not supposed to engage in combat but rather to train the army of the republic of vietnam ( arvn ) .the truman and eisenhower administrations had committed the united states to support the french and native anti-communist forces in vietnam in resisting efforts by the communists in the north to <unk> the country , though neither administration established actual combat forces in the war . the u.s. <unk> limited to financial support , military advice and <unk> intelligence <unk> after <year> when the french withdrew . during the kennedy administration , the u.s. military advisory group in south vietnam steadily increased , with mcnamara 's <unk> , from <integer> to <unk> u.s. involvement escalated after the gulf of tonkin <unk> in <month> <year> , involving two purported attacks on a u.s. navy destroyer by north vietnamese naval <unk> the kennedy administration , mcnamara was closely allied in debates in the cabinet with dean rusk , the secretary of state , with both <unk> greater american support for south vietnam . initially , the main concern of the new kennedy administration was laos , not south vietnam . in <month> <year> , mcnamara spoke in favor of intervention in laos , saying that six <unk> planes <unk> by the central intelligence agency could be <unk> to carry <unk> bombs in support of general <unk> <unk> 's forces . rusk shot down that proposal , saying his world war two experiences in burma had taught him that bombing was ineffective in the <unk> and six planes were not enough . in the spring of <year> kennedy seriously considered intervening in laos where the communist <unk> <unk> , supported by north vietnam , were winning the civil war . at one point , the joint chiefs of staff advised sending <integer> , <integer> u.s. troops into laos . however , laos was a backward , <unk> country with barely any modern roads and only two modern airfields , both of which were quite small by western standards , which would have made for a logistical <unk> . furthermore , memories of the korean war were still fresh , and it was generally accepted if the united states sent in troops into laos , it was almost certain that china would do likewise , thus leading to another <unk> war . the southeast asia treaty organization ( seato ) was split with its european members such as france and britain stoutly opposed to intervention in laos while its asian members such as thailand and the philippines were all for intervention in laos . mcnamara noted to kennedy it was quite possible that the two airfields in laos could be seized by the communist forces , which would cut off any u.s forces in laos , thus turning the intervention into a <unk> . at a meeting on <integer> <month> <year> , when questioned by the <unk> , robert f. kennedy , mcnamara stated that `` we should take a stand in thailand and south vietnam '' , <unk> <unk> laos from the nations in southeast asia to risk a war <unk> soon changed his mind about laos . on <integer> <month> <year> , he advised president kennedy to send in ground troops into laos , saying `` we must be prepared to win '' , and advising using nuclear weapons if china should intervene . on <integer> <month> , mcnamara , using more stronger language , told kennedy that the united states should definitely intervene in laos , even through he was very certain that it would lead to chinese intervention , <unk> that `` at some point , we <month> have to <unk> the use of nuclear weapons to prevent the defeat of our forces '' . kennedy , who was <unk> of the hawkish advice given by the joint chiefs of staff after the failure of the bay of pigs invasion , instead decided to seek a diplomatic solution to the laos crisis at a peace conference in geneva in <unk> that ultimately led to an agreement to make laos neutral in the cold war . the problems posed by the possibility of a war with china and the logistical problems of supporting a large units of troops in laos led mcnamara ultimately favor an alternative strategy of having a small number of u.s army special forces operate in laos working with american allies such as the <unk> hill <unk> . on <integer> <month> <year> , the joint chiefs of staff estimated to mcnamara that if chinese forces entered laos , then the seato forces would need at least <integer> divisions consisting of some <integer> , <integer> men to stop them . at the same time , the joint chiefs also estimated that the two airfields in laos were capable of landing some <integer> , <integer> troops a day each , which would give the advantage to the chinese . such <unk> assessments led kennedy to ignore mcnamara and the joint chiefs , and to favor a diplomatic solution the laos <unk> <month> <year> , when general maxwell taylor and walt whitman rostow advised sending <other>,000 american combat troops to south vietnam , mcnamara rejected that recommendation as inadequate , stating that <other>,000 troops would `` probably not <unk> the scales decisively '' , instead <unk> to kennedy that he send <integer> divisions to south vietnam . kennedy rejected that advice . in <month> <year> , mcnamara paid his first visit to south vietnam , where he told the press `` every quantitative measurement ... shows that we are winning the war '' . led by general paul d. <unk> , the officers of the military assistance command , vietnam altered a map that showed too much of south vietnam under viet cong control , and <unk> the statistics to make the viet cong appear weaker than what they were . mcnamara 's `` quantitative '' style based upon much <unk> by computers about trends in vietnam missed the human dimension . aspects of the war such popular views and attitudes in south vietnam , and that the south vietnamese president <unk> <unk> diệm favored a `` divide and rule '' strategy of having multiple government departments compete against one another as a way of <unk> in power were missed by mcnamara 's `` quantitative '' approach as there was no way that computers could calculate these aspects of the war . though mcnamara had supported plans to intervene in laos in <year> , by <year> he had changed his mind . during a discussion with general lyman <unk> , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , mcnamara had <unk> him by asking him what the united states would do in the event of several <unk> in laos , none of which <unk> and the chiefs were capable of answering . the inability of the joint chiefs to answer mcnamara 's questions about what the united states should do if north vietnam should stage a major offensive down the <unk> river valley from laos into cambodia and finally south vietnam persuaded mcnamara that the joint chiefs had no vision of the issues , and were merely advocating intervention in laos to avoid looking <unk> <year> , mcnamara supported a plan for mass <unk> of the rice fields with <unk> in the phu <unk> mountains to <unk> the viet cong out , a plan that was only stopped when w. averell harriman pointed out to kennedy that the ensuing famine would kill thousands of innocent people . in late <year> , mcnamara ordered planning to withdraw the american advisers from south vietnam in <year> as according to pentagon calculations the war should be won by then . at the time , mcnamara told kennedy : `` there is a new feeling of confidence that victory is possible '' .on <integer> <month> <year> , mcnamara 's <unk> <unk> and assumptions based upon what his computers had told him about vietnam were <unk> <unk> by the battle of ap bac , that began when three viet cong ( vc ) companies were <unk> by the arvn 's <days> division in the village of ap bac . despite being <unk> by a factor of <unk> and being <unk> having only rifles compared to the <days> division ’ s tanks , artillery , <unk> personnel <unk> and helicopters , the vc defeated the <days> division in the ensuing battle and escaped into the jungle . colonel john paul vann , the american adviser attached to the <days> division summed up the battle in a report in his usual <unk> language as : `` a <unk> fucking performance , just like what it always is '' . vann , a <unk> figure whose <unk> blunt criticism of how the war was being fought made him a favorite of the media , was much disliked by mcnamara , who did not appreciate the criticism as he continued to <unk> that the war was being <unk> 's reports criticizing diệm 's regime as corrupt and <unk> were most <unk> to mcnamara who contended that the reforms advocated by vann were unnecessary . in <month> <year> , vann resigned from the army as he was informed that his career was over . after the battle of ap bac , a debate began in the kennedy cabinet about the viability of the diệm regime , which was reinforced by the buddhist crisis , which began in <month> <year>. when the subject of supporting a coup against diệm was first raised by kennedy at a national security council meeting in <month> <year> , mcnamara spoke in favor of retaining diệm . on <integer> <month> <year> , paul <unk> , a diplomat newly returned from saigon suggested at a meeting attend by rusk , mcnamara and vice president johnson that the united states should end support for diem and leave south vietnam to its fate . mcnamara was stoutly opposed to <unk> 's suggestion , saying `` we have been winning the war '' <unk> to gain a consensus about what to do , in <month> <year> , kennedy sent mcnamara and general taylor on a `` fact-finding mission '' to south vietnam . at a meeting in the <unk> long palace , president diem showed mcnamara various graphs and charts that purported to be proof that the war was being won , a performance that convinced mcnamara the war was as good as won . kennedy wanted a negative assessment of diệm to justify supporting a coup , but mcnamara and taylor instead wrote about the `` great progress '' achieved by diệm and <unk> predicted that the `` bulk '' of the american advisers would leave in <year> as by that point they predicted the vc <unk> would be <unk> . mcnamara predicted that if diệm continued his policies , that by <year> the <unk> would be `` little more than organized <unk> '' . with the cia and the ambassador henry <unk> lodge jr. urging support for a coup while the pentagon was opposed , kennedy <unk> and finally being unable to make up his mind , gave the power of decision to lodge . lodge , who <unk> diệm , gave his approval to the generals plotting against <unk> <integer> <month> <year> , the coup was launched . after the presidential palace was overrun in the fighting , diệm was captured trying to flee saigon and executed on <integer> <month> <year>. the new government in saigon was headed by general <unk> <unk> minh . on <integer> <month> <year> , kennedy was <unk> and succeeded by lyndon johnson . in <month> <year> , johnson sent mcnamara on another `` fact-finding mission '' to south vietnam to assess general minh 's performance . on <integer> <month> <year> , mcnamara reported the situation was `` very <unk> '' as the `` current trends , unless reversed in the next two or three months , will lead to <unk> at best or more likely to a <unk> state '' . he also admitted that the computer models and statistics , which he had attached such importance to , were `` <unk> in error '' and that government control of rural areas had `` in fact been <unk> ... to a far greater extent than we realized '' since <month> . regarding minh 's regime mcnamara wrote at present `` there is no organized government in south vietnam '' . through mcnamara admitted that the new regime was `` <unk> and <unk> '' , he advised johnson to undertake `` more <unk> moves if the situation does not show early signs of improvement '' . on <integer> <month> <year> , general minh was overthrown in a <unk> coup d'état by general nguyễn khánh . the change in leadership did not affect the war . lyman <unk> of the cia reported in <month> <year> after visiting saigon that he was `` shocked by the number of our people and of the military , even those whose job is always to say we are winning , who feel the <unk> is against us '' . the same month saw a vc battalion in the <unk> delta escape from a larger force of south vietnamese troops , who had been <unk> as some of the very best in the arvn by the american advisers who had trained them , a battle that <unk> the problems in the <unk> <integer> <month> <year> , mcnamara visited south vietnam to report to president johnson about how well the new regime of khánh was handling the war . upon landing in saigon , mcnamara told the press : `` we shall stay for as long it takes to ... win the battle against the communist <unk> '' . during his visit , mcnamara spoke <unk> <unk> in <unk> vietnamese ( mcnamara kept <unk> that vietnamese is a <unk> language ) in speeches praising khánh as south vietnam 's `` best possible leader '' . mcnamara always ended his speeches by <unk> out what he thought was a phrase meaning `` long live a free vietnam ! `` , but as he used the wrong <unk> , instead he said `` vietnam , go to sleep ! '' mcnamara pressed khánh to put south vietnam on a war footing by <unk> all <unk> young men into the military , which he promised he would do . khánh did not keep his promise as wealthy and middle class south vietnamese families objected to having their sons conscripted , and as a result the burden of conscription called by khánh 's national service law fell only on sons of poor families , <unk> much <unk> . after returning to washington on <integer> <month> , mcnamara reported to johnson that the situation had `` <unk> been growing worse '' since his last visit in <month> <year> with <integer> % of the countryside now under `` <unk> control or <unk> influence '' ; most of the south vietnamese people were displaying `` <unk> and <unk> '' ; the <unk> rate in the arvn was `` high and increasing '' while the vc were `` recruiting <unk> '' . the `` greatest weakness '' accordingly to mcnamara was the `` uncertain viability '' of khánh 's government , which might be overthrown at any moment as the arvn was <unk> with <unk> and <unk> save south vietnam , mcnamara recommended that the united states make it `` <unk> clear '' its willingness to support khánh to the <unk> . other recommendations , which were accepted in a national security council `` action memorandum '' called for the united states to pay for an increase in the arvn , provide the republic of vietnam air force with more planes and helicopters , and for the united states to pay for more civil <unk> to <unk> rural south vietnam . more importantly , the `` action memorandum '' redefined the vietnam war as not only important for asia , but for the entire world as the document asserted the global credibility of the united states was now at stake as it was claimed america 's allies would lose faith in american <unk> if the south vietnamese government were overthrown . the `` action memorandum '' argued that to `` lose '' south vietnam would <unk> <unk> american global leadership , making the war a `` test case '' of american willingness to continue as a global <unk> <month> <year> , senator wayne morse called the war `` mcnamara 's war '' . in response , mcnamara told the press that he was honored , saying `` i think it is a very important war , and i am pleased to be identified with it and do whatever i can to win it '' . in <month> <year> , senator richard russell advised johnson against relying too much on mcnamara , saying `` mcnamara is the <unk> <unk> any of us know . but he 's got too <unk> 's <unk> as <unk> he 's made up his mind '' . russell told johnson that he should find an expert , <unk> a world war two general who was `` not <unk> to death of mcnamara '' to go to south vietnam to say that the war was <unk> and that the united states should <unk> out , advice that johnson <unk> south vietnam by <year> was receiving a sum of american economic and military aid that ran to $ <integer> million per day , the south vietnamese state was falling apart with corruption reaching such a point that most south vietnamese civil <unk> and soldiers were not being paid while the projects for `` rural <unk> '' that the united states had paid for had collapsed as the money had instead been <unk> . the advice that mcnamara and other american officials gave to the south vietnamese to make reforms to crack down on corruption and make the government more effective was always ignored as by this point the south vietnamese government knew very well that the americans , having repeatedly promised in public that they would never permit the `` loss '' of south vietnam , were now prisoners of their own rhetoric . the threats to <unk> aid were <unk> , which the south vietnamese exposed by simply ignoring the american advice , leading to a situation whereby stanley karnow , the vietnam correspondent for the time noted : '' ... america lacked leverage ... for the south vietnamese knew that the united states could not abandon them without damaging its own prestige . so despite their reliance on american aid , now more than a <unk> dollars a year , they could safely <unk> american <unk> . in short , their weakness was their strength '' . one south vietnamese minister told karnow at the time : `` our big advantage over the americans is that they want to win the war more than we do '' . to <unk> for the <unk> of the south vietnamese state , by late winter of <year> , senior officials in the johnson administration such as mcnamara 's deputy , william bundy , the assistant secretary of defense , were advocating american intervention in the war . such intervention presented a constitutional problem : to intervene on the scale envisioned would mean <unk> war , and only congress had the legal power to declare war . fearful of causing a war with china , johnson was opposed to the plans of khánh to invade north vietnam , and he was even less enthusiastic about having the united states invade north vietnam . to declare war on north vietnam would lead to <unk> political pressure at home to invade north vietnam . as such , the solution was <unk> for congress to pass a resolution granting johnson the power to wage war in <unk> <year> , the u.s. navy sent <unk> into the gulf of tonkin to support raids by south vietnamese <unk> on north vietnam and to gather intelligence . on <integer> <month> <year> , one destroyer , the uss maddox was involved in a naval <unk> with north vietnamese vietnam people 's navy torpedo boats within north vietnamese waters . on <integer> <month> <year> , the maddox and another destroyer , the uss turner joy , initially claimed to have been attacked by the north vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters on a <unk> night , but shortly afterward reported there was probably no attack . captain john j. <unk> of the maddox reported that the `` torpedo boats '' were almost certainly just radar `` <unk> '' caused by the `` <unk> weather effects '' of the storm and the reports of an attack on his ship were due to an `` <unk> '' radar operator who <unk> the motors of the ship for the rush of torpedoes . johnson promptly seized upon the reports of an attack on a navy <unk> in international waters to ask congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to wage war in vietnam . mcnamara , via admiral u. s. grant sharp jr. of the pacific fleet , put strong pressure on <unk> to say that his ship had been attacked by torpedo boats , despite his strong doubts on the subject . on <integer> <month> <year> , mcnamara appeared before congress to present proof of what he claimed was an attack on the navy 's <unk> in international waters of the gulf of tonkin and stated it was <unk> that congress pass the resolution as quickly as possible . records from the lyndon johnson library have indicated that mcnamara <month> have <unk> johnson on the purported attack on a u.s. navy destroyer by allegedly withholding recommendations from us pacific commanders against <unk> <unk> . mcnamara was also instrumental in presenting the event to congress and the public as justification for escalation of the war against the communists . in <year> , mcnamara met with former north vietnam defense minister <unk> <unk> giáp , who told his american counterpart that the <month> <integer> attack never happened , a conclusion mcnamara eventually came to <unk> johnson ordered operation pierce arrow , <unk> air strikes on north vietnamese naval bases . congress approved , with only senators wayne morse ( <unk> ) , and ernest <unk> ( <unk> ) , voting against , the gulf of tonkin resolution , <unk> the president `` to take all necessary measures to <unk> any armed attack against the forces of the u.s. and to prevent further aggression . '' regardless of the <unk> of the incident , the larger issue would turn out to be the sweeping powers granted by the resolution . it gave johnson virtually <unk> authority to expand retaliation for a relatively minor naval incident into a major land war involving <other>00,000 american soldiers . `` the fundamental issue of tonkin gulf involved not <unk> but , rather , <unk> of power bestowed by the resolution , '' mcnamara wrote later . though johnson now had the authority to wage war , he proved reluctant to use it , for example by ignoring the advice of the joint chiefs of staff to bomb north vietnam after a vc attack on <unk> <unk> air base killed five americans and destroyed <integer> <unk> bombers . knowing of johnson 's <unk> , on <integer> <month> <year> mcnamara recommended a `` graduated '' response program , urging johnson to launch operation <unk> roll , a bombing offensive against the part of the ho chi minh trail in the southern part of neutral laos , which was approved by the president . on christmas eve <year> , the vc bombed the <unk> hotel in saigon , killing two americans . despite mcnamara 's recommendations to bomb north vietnam , johnson still <unk> . ==== mcnamara at war ==== in <year> , in response to <unk> military activity by the vc in south vietnam and their north vietnamese allies , the u.s. began bombing north vietnam , deployed large military forces and entered into combat in south vietnam . mcnamara 's plan , supported by requests from top u.s. military commanders in vietnam , led to the commitment of <unk> troops by the end of <year> and almost <unk> by <month> <integer> , <year>. in <month> <year> , mcnamara together with the national security adviser mcgeorge bundy co-wrote a memo to president johnson stating `` both of us are now pretty well convinced that our present policy can lead only to disastrous defeat '' as it was hopeless to expect the unstable and corrupt south vietnamese government to defeat the vc who were steadily `` gaining in the countryside '' . bundy and mcnamara wrote `` the time for has come for hard choices '' as the united states now had the alternatives of either negotiating with north vietnam to `` salvage what little can be preserved '' or to resort to intervention to `` force a change '' . both bundy and mcnamara stated that they favored the latter , arguing that the commitment of u.s troops to fight in south vietnam and a strategic bombing campaign against north vietnam were now required . mcnamara 's hawkish stance on vietnam was well known in washington and many in the press often referred to the war as `` mcnamara 's war '' as he was the one in the cabinet always pressing for greater american <unk> <month> <year> , the vc attacked the american airfield at <unk> , killing <integer> americans and destroying <integer> aircraft . after hearing of the attack , johnson assembled his national security team together with the speaker of the house of representatives , john w. <unk> , and the senate majority leader , mike mansfield , to announce `` i 've had enough of this '' . only mansfield and the vice president , <unk> humphrey , objected to johnson 's plans to bomb north vietnam . aircraft from the carrier , uss ranger , launched operation <unk> <unk> bombing the north vietnamese army base at <unk> <unk> later that day . mcnamara was forced to tell johnson that the <unk> <unk> raids had done little damage owning to the heavy clouds , which caused the pilots to miss when <unk> their bombs , and more raids would be needed . on <integer> <month> , johnson ordered more bombing raids , and <integer> <month> approved operation rolling thunder , a strategic bombing offensive against north vietnam that was originally planned to last eight weeks , and instead went on for three years . after the bombing raids started , general william westmoreland of the military assistance command , vietnam ( <unk> ) , <unk> johnson to say that da <unk> air base was vulnerable as he had no faith in the ability of the south vietnamese to protect it , leading him to ask for american troops to be deployed instead . on <integer> <month> <year> , two <unk> from the united states marine corps were landed at <unk> , making the beginning of the ground war for the united states . on <integer> <month> , mcnamara urged johnson to send <other>0,000 troops to vietnam , advice that was <unk> <month> <year> , westmoreland was reporting that south vietnam was faced with a `` collapse '' , which would require <other>80,000 troops to stop , which would be just a `` <unk> '' , and another <other>00,000 troops would be needed `` to seize the initiative from the enemy '' . mcnamara 's advice in <month> <year> to johnson was to commit more <other>80,000 troops to south vietnam together with a stepped up <unk> offensive to destroy north vietnam 's economy was called by bundy `` <unk> to the point of <unk> '' . bundy stated that for johnson to agree to mcnamara 's request to send more troops `` was a <unk> slope toward total u.s. responsibility and corresponding <unk> on the vietnamese side '' . bundy argued that it was the responsibility of the south vietnamese government to stop the vc and that if the americans continued to do all the fighting , then the united states would lack the necessary leverage to pressure saigon into making reforms , turning `` ... the conflict into a white man 's war , with the united states in the <unk> of the french '' . to resolve the debate , later in <month> <year> , mcnamara visited south vietnam on yet another `` fact-finding mission '' for president johnson and met the new south vietnamese premier , air marshal nguyễn cao kỳ , who had just overthrown khánh . air marshal kỳ wore a <unk> <unk> which he had designed himself of a white <unk> , black <unk> , red <unk> and black <unk> which led mcnamara to <unk> him as looking `` like a <unk> player in a <unk> <unk> '' . mcnamara was not impressed with kỳ , reporting to johnson that he saw little evidence that he was capable of winning the war , and the united states would have to send more troops to south vietnam . upon his return to the united states , mcnamara told the press that the u.s forces in vietnam were inflicting `` increasingly heavy losses '' on the vc , but in private told president johnson that the situation was `` worse than a year ago '' <unk> also advised the president that by early <year> he would have to send <other>00,000 more troops to south vietnam in order to win the war , and he would need to mobilize the reserves and state national guards as well . johnson accepted the first recommendation while rejecting the latter , <unk> bundy 's <unk> that to send more troops would <unk> mean less leverage over south vietnam . to mobilize the reserves and national guards would mean having to call up hundreds of thousands of men from civilian life , which would inevitably <unk> the economy , which in turn would require ending the <unk> economy and putting the economy on a war footing . johnson rejected a wartime economy as imposing too many sacrifices on ordinary americans while <unk> his chances for reelection . because the reserves were never called up , the army had to send much of its <unk> to vietnam , leaving the u.s divisions in western europe in a `` skeletal '' condition as there was a shortage of volunteers . to make up the <unk> , the army had to rely upon the draft , which caused much domestic opposition , especially as the draft system offered generous <unk> for those attending university and college , leading to the burden of the draft falling <unk> upon men from poorer families . because of the <unk> to call up the reserves , mcnamara had to increase the draft call in <month> <year> from <unk> per month to <other>5,000 per month . as most of the <integer> and <unk> <unk> had a high school diploma or less , this also led to a decline in the army 's intellectual standards , with many officers <unk> that most of the <unk> were not intelligent enough to be trained for technical duties or promoted up the ranks . throughout the war , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , general <unk> wheeler , pressed very strongly for the reserves and national guards to be called out , saying the war was steadily <unk> the u.s. army . though mcnamara warned the president in <month> <year> that the war would cost an extra $ <integer> billion dollars in defense spending over the next year , johnson at a press conference said his administration would be spending only an extra $ <unk> million dollars until <month> <year>. mcnamara warned that the increased spending would spark inflation and raise the deficit , advising johnson to ask congress to increase taxes to <unk> those <unk> . johnson responded that congress would not vote for higher taxes , leading mcnamara to argue that the president should at least try , saying `` i would rather fight for what 's right and fail than not try '' . johnson snapped : `` <unk> , bob , that 's what 's wrong with <unk> are n't a politician '' .on <integer> <month> <year> , norman morrison , a quaker <unk> himself alive in the <unk> lot of the pentagon to protest the war . all mcnamara saw from his office was the smoke rising from the <unk> lot , but he was sufficiently troubled by the incident that he refused to discuss it with his family , all the more so because his wife <unk> was opposed to the war and <unk> with morrison 's feelings , if not his suicide . on <integer> <month> <year> , mcnamara sent johnson a memo saying that the `` substantial loss of american lives '' in vietnam was worth the <unk> in order to contain china , which mcnamara called the world 's most dangerous nation . mcnamara wrote that the deployment of troops to south vietnam would `` make sense only if they are in support of a long-term united states policy to contain china '' , writing that the process of `` containing '' china would require `` american attention , money and , from time to time unfortunately lives '' .the <unk> lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated . mcnamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in vietnam . he concluded that there were a limited number of vc fighters in south vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them . he applied <unk> ( body counts ) to determine how close to success his plan was . faced with a guerrilla war , the question of holding territory was irrelevant as the vc never operated for extended periods in areas where the americans were strong and if the americans occupied an area in force , the vc simply moved to other areas where the american presence was weaker . westmoreland had decided , with the support of mcnamara , to defend all of south vietnam , believing that he could win via a strategy of attrition as he would simply <unk> enough losses to end the enemy 's ability to wage war . mcnamara devised the `` body count '' measurement to determine how well the americans were doing , reasoning if the americans were inflicting heavy losses as measured by the `` body count '' , it must be a sign that they were winning . general william peers wrote critically of the `` body count '' strategy , stating : `` ... with improper leadership , <unk> count ' could create competition between units , particularly if these statistics were compared like baseball <unk> and there were no <unk> requirements as to how and by whom the counts were to be made '' . the <unk> with `` body counts '' led to much <unk> of the losses inflicted on the enemy as the officers with the highest `` body counts '' were promoted while also <unk> a <unk> competition between units to achieve the highest `` body counts '' that led to innocent civilians being killed to <unk> their daily `` body counts '' . it is generally accepted by historians that the vast daily losses that u.s. officers claimed to have inflicted on the vc were fabricated as many officers <unk> for a promotion reported `` body counts '' well above what they were actually <unk> u.s. army <unk> the efforts of kennedy and mcnamara to develop a more counterinsurgency role by simply declaring that the army 's basic unit , the division , was flexible enough to engage against guerrillas while also promising that the traditional <unk> for using maximum firepower would not present a problem as firepower use would be `` <unk> '' . in vietnam , this led to divisions , whose size limited them and their supply <unk> to the road , using massive amounts of firepower against guerrillas who were often `` <unk> '' enough to evade all of the firepower brought to bear . instead , the standard tactics of bringing massive firepower to bear in the form of <unk> and artillery strikes against the guerrillas often killed civilians , <unk> support for the vc . the special forces did fight in vietnam , but only as an <unk> to the traditional infantry and <unk> divisions , which did most of the fighting . in a <year> memo , mcnamara admitted that the sort of counterinsurgency war envisioned by kennedy with the special forces leading the fight had not occurred , and wrote that the responsibility for this `` <unk> lies with bad management '' on the part of the army . ==== <unk> ==== up to <month> <year> , mcnamara , who been a supporter of the war , first started to have doubts about the war , saying at a press conference that `` it will be a long war '' , which completely <unk> his previous optimistic statements that the war would be brought to a close soon . although he was a prime architect of the vietnam war and repeatedly <unk> the jcs on strategic matters , mcnamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by <unk> more troops to south vietnam and <unk> the bombing of north vietnam , a claim he would publish in a book years later . he also stated later that his support of the war was given out of loyalty to administration policy . he traveled to south vietnam many times to study the situation <unk> and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force <unk> requested by the military <unk> a christmas gesture , johnson ordered a bombing pause over north vietnam and went off to his ranch in texas for the holidays . mcnamara went with his family for <unk> in colorado , but upon hearing that the president was open to extending the bombing pause for a few more days , he left his family at the sky lodge in the <unk> to fly to the johnson ranch on <integer> <month> <year>. mcnamara knew that johnson tended to listen to the advice of rusk who saw extending the bombing pause as weakness , and wanted a meeting with johnson without rusk present . mcnamara argued to the president in a three hour long meeting that the north vietnamese would not open peace talks unless the bombing were stopped first , as they kept saying repeatedly , and persuaded johnson to extend the bombing pause into <month> . at a new year 's eve party attended by washington 's elite to welcome <year> , mcnamara expressed doubts about america 's ability to win the war . a week later at a dinner party attended by the economist john kenneth galbraith and johnson 's speechwriter dick goodwin , mcnamara stated that victory was <unk> , and the best that could be achieved was an `` <unk> withdrawal '' that might save south vietnam as a state . in <month> <year> , during the honolulu conference , mcnamara during an `` off-the-record '' <unk> with a group of journalists spoke about the war in very <unk> terms , stating frankly that operation rolling thunder was a failure . mcnamara stated that north vietnam was a backward third world country that did not have the same advanced industrial infrastructure of first world nations , making the bombing offensive <unk> . mcnamara concluded : `` no amount of bombing can end the war '' . karnow , one of the journalists present during the `` off-the-record '' conversation , described mcnamara 's personality as having changed , noting the defense secretary , who was normally so <unk> and <unk> , convinced he could `` scientifically '' solve any problem , as being <unk> and clearly less <unk> <month> <year> , mcnamara returned from yet another visit to south vietnam , full of confidence in public and doubt in private . mcnamara told the media that `` process has exceeded our expectations '' while telling the president he saw `` no reasonable way to bring the war to an end soon '' . though mcnamara reported to johnson that american forces were inflicting heavy losses on the north vietnamese and vc , he added that they could `` more than replace '' their losses and that `` full security exists nowhere '' in south vietnam , even in areas <unk> `` <unk> '' by the americans . worst of all , mcnamara complained that the south vietnamese were still not carrying their full share of the load , as they expected the americans to do all the fighting for them , stating : `` this important war must be fought and won by the vietnamese themselves . we have known this from the beginning . but the <unk> truth is that , as was the case in <year> and <year> and <year> , we have not found the formula , the <unk> , for training and inspiring them into effective action '' .in <month> <year> , mcnamara visited harvard university and the car driving him to see henry kissinger was surrounded by anti-war protesters who forced the automobile to stop . the students refused to let the car move until mcnamara debated their leader , michael <unk> , the president of the harvard chapter of students for a democratic society . mcnamara agreed to the debate , and standing on the <unk> of his car answered the charge from a student in the crowd that the united states was <unk> aggression by saying the war started in <year> , not <year> , which he knew `` because the international control commission wrote a report that said so . you have n't read it , and if you have , you obviously did n't understand it '' . when the student answered that he had read the international control commission 's report and it did not say that , mcnamara responded he had been a far better university student than his opponent , saying `` i was tougher than you then and i 'm tougher today ! i was more <unk> then , and i hope i 'm more <unk> today ! '' . as mcnamara continued to <unk> the crowd and the mood grew more ugly , he fled into <unk> house , from which he escaped via underground tunnels to see kissinger . the confrontation with the students had shaken him , and it took half an hour before he was ready to address kissinger 's <unk> the effects of operation rolling thunder were more easily measured than with the ground war , mcnamara was especially troubled by the revelation that the bombing offensive had not caused the collapse of north vietnam 's economy as predicted . in <month> <year> , american bombers hit north vietnam 's hydroelectric plants and reduced north vietnam capacity to generate electricity by <integer> % , accordingly to mcnamara 's calculations . at the same time , he also calculated that the annual amount of electricity generated in north vietnam was equal only to a fifth of the electricity generated every year at the <unk> electric power company 's plant in alexandria , virginia , making the destruction of north vietnamese power plants <unk> to the outcome of the war as the amount of electricity generated was so small . he also calculated in <year> that over the last two years , american bombers had inflicted damage on north vietnam equal to about $ <integer> million while at the same time , rolling thunder had cost the u.s. air force about <integer> aircraft shot down over north vietnam whose total value was about $ <integer> million , making the bombing campaign <unk> . mcnamara 's doubts were encouraged by his civilian <unk> such as leslie h. gelb and john mcnaughton , who complained that their <unk> and teenage children were <unk> them as `` war criminals '' when they came home from work . mcnamara 's own teenage son , robert craig mcnamara , was opposed to the war and denounced his father when he came from work every day . mcnamara was shocked to discover that the american flag was <unk> upside down in his son 's <unk> as the younger mcnamara told him that he was <unk> of america because of him . mcnaughton told mcnamara that after having talked to some of the young people that `` a feeling is widely and strongly held ... that 'the establishment ' is out of its mind '' and the dominant opinion was `` that we are trying to impose some u.s. image on distant peoples we can not understand and that we carrying the thing to <unk> <unk> . `` in a memo of <integer> <month> <year> to the president , mcnamara stated the military side of the war was going well with the americans killing thousands of the enemy every month , but the political side was not as south vietnam remained as <unk> as ever as he wrote : `` corruption is widespread . real government control is confined to <unk> . there is <unk> in the <unk> '' . mcnamara wrote that the idea that the american forces would temporarily stabilize the situation so the south vietnamese could take over the war themselves was <unk> as the <unk> south vietnamese state would never be able to win the war , thus meaning the americans would have to stay in vietnam for decades to come . he advised johnson not to accept westmoreland 's call for an additional <other>00,000 soldiers as that would mean calling up the reserves , which in turn would require a wartime economy . the economic sacrifices that ending the <unk> economy would <unk> would make it almost politically impossible to negotiate peace , and in effect would mean placing the hawks in charge , which was why those of a hawkish inclination kept pressing for the reserves to be called up . the economic sacrifices could only be justified to the american people by saying the war would be brought to a victorious conclusion . mcnamara rejected the advice of the hawks , warning that steps such as bombing north vietnam 's <unk> and <unk> to flood the <unk> with the aim of causing a famine ; mining the coast of north vietnam to sink soviet ships bringing in arms ; invading laos and cambodia ; and finally in the last resort using nuclear weapons if the other measures failed were likely to <unk> world opinion and increase domestic opposition . mcnamara wrote : `` the picture of the world 's greatest <unk> killing or seriously <unk> <other>,000 <unk> a week , while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are <unk> disputed , is not a pretty one '' . finally , mcnamara dismissed the domino theory as irrelevant since general <unk> had seized power in indonesia in <year> and proceeded to <unk> out the indonesian communist party , the <unk> in the world , killing hundreds of thousands of indonesian communists . he argued that with <unk> in power in indonesia that `` the trend in asia was now running in america 's favor , which reduced the importance of south vietnam '' . to the americans , indonesia was the most important of all the `` dominoes '' in southeast asia , and mcnamara argued that even if the south vietnamese `` domino '' were to fall , the indonesian `` domino '' would still stand . mcnamara commissioned the vietnam study task force on <month> <integer> , <year>. he was inspired by the confrontation at harvard the previous <month> as he had discovered that the students he had been debating knew more about vietnam 's history than he did . the task was assigned to gelb and six officials who were instructed by mcnamara to examine just how and why the united states became involved in vietnam , starting with american relations with the viet minh in world war two . through gelb was a hawk who had written <unk> speeches for the republican senator jacob <unk> , he and his team became disillusioned as they wrote the history ; at one point when discussing what were the lessons of vietnam , paul <unk> , one of the historians went up to the <unk> to write simply , `` do n't . '' by <month> <year> , the report of the office of the secretary of defense vietnam task force , as the pentagon papers were officially titled , was finished , but widely ignored within the government . intended as the official record of us military involvement in indochina , the final report ran to <other>,000 pages and was classified as `` top secret – sensitive . '' the report was ultimately leaked in <year> to the new york times by daniel ellsberg , a former aide to mcnamara 's assistant secretary of defense , john mcnaughton . the leak became known as the pentagon papers , revealing that mcnamara and others had been aware that the vietnam offensive was <unk> . subsequent efforts by the nixon administration to prevent such <unk> led indirectly to the <unk> scandal . mcnamara said that the domino theory was the main reason for entering the vietnam war . in the same interview he stated , `` kennedy had n't said before he died whether , faced with the loss of vietnam , he would [ completely ] withdraw ; but i believe today that had he faced that choice , he would have withdrawn . '' === social equality === to commemorate president harry s truman 's signing an order to end segregation in the military , mcnamara issued directive <decimal> on <month> <integer> , <year>. this directive , equal opportunity in the armed forces , dealt directly with the issue of racial and gender discrimination in areas surrounding military communities . the directive declared , `` every military commander has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their <unk> and to foster equal opportunity for them , not only in areas under his immediate control , but also in nearby communities where they <month> live or gather in <unk> hours . '' ( para . <unk> . ) under the directive , commanding officers were <unk> to use the economic power of the military to influence local businesses in their treatment of minorities and women . with the approval of the secretary of defense , the commanding officer could declare areas <unk> to military personnel for discriminatory practices . === expulsion of the chagos <unk> === in <month> <year> , mcnamara was informed by the british defense minister , peter <unk> , that the financial burden of trying to maintain british forces around the world was too much , and that the british prime minister harold macmillan was considering a withdrawal of all british forces `` east of suez '' to end the british military presence in asia . mcnamara was opposed to the contemplated `` east of suez '' withdrawal , but the possibility of such a withdrawal led the u.s. navy to lobby for britain to allow an american naval base to be set up some british island in the indian ocean , a viewpoint that was formally endorsed by the joint chiefs of staff in <month> <year>. the memo by the joint chiefs mentioned that a major problem with british colonies was the rise of nationalist movements demanding independence , and expressed concern that if the united kingdom were to grant the united states a base in the indian ocean , an independence movement might demand the withdrawal of the americans . in <year> , britain granted air and naval bases in the colony of trinidad and tobago to the united states , but when trinidad and tobago became independent , the new government asked for the americans to leave . in addition , the chagossians were black , and the u.s. navy were convinced that having the chagossians living aside an american naval base would result in <unk> , which in turn would lead to american sailors being infected with <unk> diseases , thus leading the navy to demand that the chagossians being <unk> <month> <year> , <unk> visited washington to meet mcnamara and to begin talks about which british island in the indian ocean was to have the american base . by <year> , the americans had selected the island of diego garcia in the british colony of the chagos archipelago as the ideal place for maintaining air and naval bases that would allow the united states to control the indian ocean . mcnamara offered to have the united states pay $ <integer> million u.s. dollars annually in rent to the british government , a request that the british accepted . to prevent an independence movement in the chagos islands from emerging , the americans informed the british that they wanted all of the chagos islands expelled from their homes and never to be allowed to returned , a request that the british agreed . the british government expelled all of the chagossians from their homes starting in <year> . === abm === toward the end of his term mcnamara also opposed an <unk> missile ( abm ) system proposed for <unk> in the u.s. in defense against soviet missiles , arguing the $ <integer> billion `` in itself is not the problem ; the <unk> of the proposed <unk> is the problem . '' under pressure to <unk> with the abm program after it became clear that the soviets had begun a similar project , mcnamara finally agreed to a `` light '' system which he believed could protect against the far smaller number of chinese missiles . however , he never believed it was wise for the united states to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear <unk> and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective . he always believed that the best defense strategy for the u.s. was a parity of mutually assured destruction with the soviet union . an abm system would be an ineffective weapon as compared to an increase in deployed nuclear missile capacity . === departure === mcnamara wrote of his close personal friendship with <unk> kennedy and how she demanded that he stop the killing in vietnam . as mcnamara grew more and more controversial after <year> and his differences with the president and the joint chiefs of staff over vietnam strategy became the subject of public speculation , frequent rumors <unk> that he would leave office . by <year> , mcnamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without <unk> and he suffered <unk> where his <unk> would <unk> <unk> for hours . johnson said about him : `` you know , he 's a fine man , a wonderful man , bob mcnamara . he has given everything , just about everything , and , you know , we just ca n't afford another <unk> '' ( a reference to the first defense secretary , james <unk> , who committed suicide due to <unk> stress and depression ) . senator john c. stennis was a conservative southern democrat who enjoyed much influence as a senior member of the senate armed forces committee . stennis saw himself more as a champion of the military rather than its <unk> , and as such the military often leaked information to him , in the full knowledge that he would take up their cause on capitol hill . reflecting their <unk> with mcnamara 's leadership , in the spring of <year> senior generals and <unk> let stennis know of their belief that the defense secretary was <unk> the war , which led him to schedule hearings for the senate armed forces committee in <month> <year> to examine the charge that `` <unk> civilian <unk> '' ( i.e . mcnamara ) were not letting `` professional military experts '' win the war as he charged that mcnamara had placed too many restrictions on bombing north vietnam to protect innocent north vietnamese civilians . the chairman of the senate armed forces committee , senator richard russell jr. , was opposed to the war , but he expressed his opposition in the most cautious and <unk> terms as he did not wish to appear <unk> , and so the hawkish stennis enjoyed more power than his title of deputy chairman of the committee would <unk> hearings opened on <integer> <month> <year> , and stennis called as his witnesses numerous <unk> and air force generals who all testified to their belief that the united states was fighting with `` one arm tied behind its back '' , <unk> criticizing mcnamara 's leadership as they complained of `` <unk> restrictive controls '' in bombing north vietnam that they claimed were preventing them from winning the war . when mcnamara himself appeared as a witness before the senate armed forces committee on <integer> <month> <year> , he defended the war in very <unk> terms that strongly suggested he had lost faith in the war , <unk> that the bombing campaign against north vietnam was ineffective , making the question of the bombing restrictions <unk> . mcnamara described all of the <integer> restricted targets as either of no importance such as a <unk> factory in hanoi that produced only <integer> <unk> per day or carried too much risk of <unk> soviet ships bringing supplies to north vietnam . he warned that the prospect of american bombers damaging or <unk> soviet <unk> while <unk> or killing soviet sailors carried too much risk of causing world war three . mcnamara testified that the bombing campaign had failed to reduce the supplies coming down the ho chi minh trail as the viet cong needed only <integer> tons of supplies per day to continue to fight and `` even if the quantity were five times that amount , it could be transported by only a few <unk> '' . mcnamara went on to say that the bombing raids had not <unk> the north vietnamese economy which was `` agrarian and simple '' and the north vietnamese people were unfamiliar with `` the modern <unk> and <unk> that most of us in the western world take for granted '' . mcnamara also stated that north vietnamese morale was not broken by the bombing offensive as the north vietnamese people were `` <unk> to discipline and are no <unk> to <unk> and death '' while everything indicated the leadership in hanoi were not affected by the bombing raids . thus , he lacked `` any confidence that they can be bombed to the negotiating table '' . mcnamara concluded that only some sort of genocide could actually win the war , stating : `` enemy operations in the south can not , on the basis of any reports i have seen be stopped by air <unk> , that is , of the virtual <unk> of north vietnam and its people '' <unk> stennis , the other members of the senate armed forces committee were senators henry m. jackson , <unk> thurmond and stuart <unk> , all of whom were very <unk> to mcnamara in their questioning of him . senator thurmond <unk> mcnamara : `` i think it is a statement of <unk> the communists . it is a statement of <unk> the communists . it is a statement of <unk> '' . privately , mcnamara felt that thurmond was an `` ass '' , saying he was a <unk> , <unk> southern politician whose only values were a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> belief in white <unk> and a <unk> for marrying women far younger than himself . mcnamara felt that it was <unk> him to be questioned by thurmond , which explained why he was notably <unk> in his answers to thurmond . stennis wrote the committee 's report which accused mcnamara of having `` consistently <unk> the unanimous recommendations of military commanders and the joint chiefs of staff '' , whom stennis wrote had proposed `` systematic , timely and <unk> actions '' . stennis <unk> mcnamara for putting in bombing restrictions to protect north vietnamese civilians and claimed that the war could be easily won if only mcnamara would just obey all of the advice he received from the military . stennis was not influenced by the hearings as he had written the committee 's report before the hearings had even began . johnson saw the hearings as proof that it was time to dismiss mcnamara , whom he believed was `` <unk> up '' under the strain of the war , as reflected in the defense secretary 's criticism of the rolling thunder <unk> . stennis , an <unk> white <unk> who had <unk> opposed johnson 's civil rights legislation , was an old enemy of johnson 's , which led the president to decide not to <unk> mcnamara in <month> <year> as that would be seen as a victory by stennis , and instead to <unk> a few months to fire mcnamara . in an interview with his biographer , doris kearns goodwin , johnson stated that mcnamara was `` <unk> up '' as the pressures of the war were too much for him , and so he decided to fire him as it would have been `` a damn unfair thing to force him to stay '' . johnson had long <unk> and hated the kennedy brothers , whom he charged looked down upon him as `` white <unk> '' from texas . senator robert f. kennedy had emerged as a leading critic of the war by <year> , and johnson stated to kearns his belief that mcnamara had suffered a nervous breakdown , of which kennedy , a close friend of mcnamara , had taken advantage of . johnson told kearns : `` every day , bobby [ kennedy ] would call up mcnamara telling him that the war was terrible and immoral , and that he had to leave '' . to <unk> the blow , johnson claimed to kearns that he had talked it over with mcnamara and had decided to offer him the presidency of the world bank , `` the only job he really wanted then '' . johnson had chosen the job of world bank president for mcnamara because its rules prohibited the president from involving himself in the domestic affairs of member nations , which would prevent mcnamara from criticizing the war after he left office . johnson 's biggest fear was that if he fired mcnamara , then he might join with kennedy in criticizing him and the war ; given his status as the <unk> defense secretary , such criticism would be especially damaging . when a reporter asked mcnamara if the stennis hearings indicated a <unk> between him and the joint chiefs of staff , mcnamara replied : `` my <unk> do n't <unk> with those of the joint chiefs and i think they would be the first to say it '' . general <unk> `` bus '' wheeler , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff had become dissatisfied with mcnamara 's leadership and was outraged by that remark . in response to mcnamara 's claim that the joint chiefs supported him , he proposed that the joint chiefs all resign in protest at mcnamara 's leadership . general harold k. johnson of the army , who erroneously blamed mcnamara for johnson 's decision not to call up the reserves in <year> , agreed to wheeler 's plan with his only regret being that he did not resign in <year>. the plan collapsed when general wallace m. <unk> of the marine corps refused to go along with <unk> <integer> <month> <year> , mcnamara saw the <month> on the pentagon anti-war protest from his office in the pentagon as he witnessed <unk> girls placed <unk> in the guns of the d.c national guardsman standing in front of the pentagon . mcnamara described the scenes he witnessed as `` <unk> '' as the <unk> girls <unk> their <unk> to <unk> the guardsman to `` make love , not war '' while other <unk> <unk> in the faces of the guardsman . however , despite seeing the <month> on the pentagon <unk> as a sign of social decay , his characteristic competitive spirit came to the <unk> as he argued that if he had been leading the <month> on the pentagon , he would had taken over the pentagon and <unk> it down , saying <unk> lacked the necessary discipline and intelligence . on <integer> <month> <year> , mcnamara wrote johnson a memo which he sent the next day saying that the war could not be continued as it `` would be dangerous , costly in lives and unsatisfactory to the american people '' . johnson wrote on the <unk> on the memo remarks such as `` how do we get this conclusion ? '' and `` why believe this ? `` in an early <month> <year> memorandum to johnson , mcnamara 's recommendation to freeze troop levels , stop bombing north vietnam and for the u.s. to hand over ground fighting to south vietnam was rejected <unk> by the president . mcnamara 's recommendations amounted to his saying that the strategy of the united states in vietnam which had been pursued to date had failed . mcnamara later stated he `` never heard back '' from johnson regarding the memo . largely as a result , on <month> <integer> of that year , mcnamara announced his <unk> resignation and that he would become president of the world bank . other factors were the increasing intensity of the anti-war movement in the u.s. , the <unk> presidential campaign in which johnson was expected to seek re-election , and mcnamara 's <unk> the <unk> of the joint chiefs of staff , of construction along the <days> parallel separating south and north vietnam of a line of <unk> running from the coast of vietnam into laos . the president 's announcement of mcnamara 's move to the world bank stressed his stated interest in the job and that he <unk> a change after seven years as secretary of defense ( longer than any of his predecessors or successors ) . others give a different view of mcnamara 's departure from office . for example , stanley karnow in his book vietnam : a history strongly suggests that mcnamara was asked to leave by the president . the historian arthur schlesinger , jr stated that he was present during a conversation between mcnamara and senator kennedy during which the former told the latter that he only learned from reading the newspapers of johnson 's announcement that he had just `` resigned '' as defense secretary and had been appointed president of the world bank . mcnamara himself expressed uncertainty about the question . on <integer> <month> <year> , a story in the financial times of london based on leaked sources in washington stated mcnamara was going to be the next world bank president , which came as a considerable surprise to mcnamara . afterwards , mcnamara met with kennedy who told him to resign in protest and <unk> the war as <unk> , counsel that mcnamara rejected , saying that johnson had been a friend and that he was still loyal to him . when mcnamara refused to resign , kennedy told him that he should turn down the world bank presidency and join him in criticizing the war , which mcnamara refused to do . johnson knew that mcnamara was concerned about poverty in the third world , and that the possibility of serving as world bank president would be too <unk> for mcnamara to <unk> left office on <month> <integer> , <year> ; for his efforts , the president awarded him both the medal of freedom and the distinguished service medal . mcnamara 's last day as defense secretary was a memorable one . the hawkish national security adviser , walt whitman rostow , argued at a cabinet meeting that day that the united states was on the <unk> of winning the war . rostow urged johnson to send <unk> more american troops to south vietnam to join the <unk> already there and to drastically increase the number of bombing raids on north vietnam . at that point , mcnamara snapped in <unk> at rostow , saying : `` what then ? this <unk> bombing campaign , it 's worth nothing , it 's done nothing , they dropped more bombs than on all of europe in all of world war ii and it has n't done a fucking thing ! '' mcnamara then broke down in tears , saying to johnson to just accept that the war could not be won and stop listening to rostow . henry <unk> , an aide to the president , recalled the scene : `` he <unk> off the familiar <unk> we had dropped more bombs on vietnam than on all of europe during world war ii . then his voice broke , and there were tears on his eyes as he spoke of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the air war . the rest of us sat <unk> for one with my <unk> open , listening to the secretary of defense talk that way about a campaign for which he had , ultimately , been responsible . i was pretty shocked '' . shortly after mcnamara departed the pentagon , he published the essence of security , discussing various aspects of his tenure and position on basic national security issues . he did not speak out again on defense issues or vietnam until after he left the world bank . == world bank president == robert mcnamara served as head of the world bank from <month> <year> to <month> <year> , when he turned <decimal> in <month> <year> , mcnamara 's friend senator robert kennedy entered the democratic primaries with aim of challenging johnson . kennedy asked mcnamara to tape a statement praising his leadership during the cuban missile crisis with the understanding that the statement was meant for a tv ad . mcnamara praised kennedy 's `` <unk> diplomacy '' , saying he had `` remained calm and <unk> , firm , but <unk> , never <unk> and never <unk> '' . though this was a violation of world bank rules , mcnamara felt guilty over <unk> kennedy 's requests to resign and decline the world bank presidency . he was attacked for the tape with the new york times in an editorial <unk> him for his `` poor judgement and poorer taste '' . for a moment , mcnamara feared he would be fired from the world <unk> safe was installed in mcnamara 's office at the world bank to house his papers relating to his time as defense secretary , which was a normal <unk> extended to former defense secretaries who might face controversy over their actions and wish to defend themselves by quoting from the documentary record . when the pentagon papers were finished in <month> <year> , and a copy of the papers were brought into mcnamara 's office , he became angry and said : `` i do n't want to see it ! take it back ! '' by <year> , mcnamara wanted to forget the vietnam war and did not want any <unk> of his former job . === tenure === in his <integer> years at the bank , he introduced key changes , most notably , shifting the bank 's economic development policies toward targeted poverty reduction . prior to his tenure at the world bank , poverty did not receive substantial attention as part of international and national economic development ; the focus of development had been on industrialization and infrastructure . poverty also came to be redefined as a condition faced by people rather than countries . according to martha <unk> , the world bank under mcnamara 's tenure `` sold '' states poverty reduction `` through a mixture of persuasion and <unk> . '' mcnamara negotiated , with the conflicting countries represented on the board , a growth in funds to channel credits for development , in the form of health , food , and education projects . he also instituted new methods of evaluating the effectiveness of funded projects . one notable project started during mcnamara 's tenure was the effort to prevent river <unk> <year> , mcnamara visited santiago to meet president salvador allende to discuss the latter 's policy of nationalization , especially of the copper mining companies . mcnamara 's son , craig mcnamara was living in chile at the time , but the two did not meet owning to the <unk> over the vietnam war . mcnamara files stated in <year> : `` i think my father truly respected <unk> compassion , his <unk> . but he <unk> of the <unk> '' . the meeting with allende concluded with mcnamara ending all world bank loans to chile . on <integer> <month> <year> , allende was overthrown in a coup <unk> led by general <month>o pinochet . in <year> , mcnamara visited santiago to meet pinochet and agreed to the world bank <unk> loans to chile . craig mcnamara , who was visiting the united states at the time of the coup and chose not to return to chile was outraged by the decision to resume the loans , telling his father in a phone call : `` you ca n't do <unk> always say the world bank is not a political institution , but financing pinochet clearly would be '' . mcnamara <unk> <unk> stated in reply : `` it 's too late . i 've already made my decision '' . mcnamara <unk> <unk> that his father 's claim that he had to cease loans to chile because the allende government 's nationalization policy was an `` economic '' matter that fell within the <unk> of the world bank , but human rights abuses under pinochet were a `` political '' matter that was outside of the world bank 's <unk> was <unk> and <unk> . craig mcnamara stated : `` i was really upset by that . that was hard to <unk> '' .the world bank currently has a scholarship program under his <unk> world bank president , he declared at the <year> annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank group that countries <unk> birth control practices would get <unk> access to resources . during the emergency in india , mcnamara remarked `` at long last , india is moving to effectively address its population problem , '' regarding the forced sterilization . == <unk> bank activities and assessments == from <year> to <year> , mcnamara served on the board of trustees at american university in washington , <unk> <year> , mcnamara joined several other former national security officials in urging that the united states pledge to not use nuclear weapons first in europe in the event of hostilities ; subsequently he proposed the <unk> of nuclear weapons as an element of nato 's defense posture . in <year> , washington journalist deborah shapley published a <unk> biography of robert mcnamara titled promise and power : the life and times of robert mcnamara . shapley concluded her book with these words : `` for better and worse mcnamara shaped much in today 's world – and imprisoned himself . a little-known nineteenth century writer , f.w . <unk> , offers a <unk> : <unk> make our decisions . and then our decisions turn around and make us . ' '' mcnamara 's memoir , in retrospect : the tragedy and lessons of vietnam , published in <year> , presented an account and analysis of the vietnam war from his point of view . according to his lengthy new york times obituary , `` [ h ] e concluded well before leaving the pentagon that the war was <unk> , but he did not share that insight with the public until late in life . in <year> , he took a stand against his own conduct of the war , <unk> in a memoir that it was <unk> , <unk> wrong ' . '' in return , he faced a `` <unk> of scorn '' at that time . in <month> <year> , mcnamara returned to vietnam , this time visiting hanoi . despite his role as one of the architects of operation rolling thunder , mcnamara met with a surprisingly warm reception , even from those who survived the bombing raids , and was often asked to <unk> <unk> editions of in retrospect which had been illegally translated and published in vietnam . during his visit , mcnamara met his opposite number during the war , general <unk> <unk> giáp who served as north vietnam 's defense minister . the american historian charles neu who was present at the <unk> meeting observed the differences in the style of the two men with mcnamara repeatedly <unk> giáp to ask questions , usually related to something numerical , while giáp gave a long <unk> <unk> , quoting various vietnamese cultural figures such as <unk> , that began with vietnamese <unk> against china during the years <integer> <unk> ad when vietnam was a chinese province . neu wrote his impression was that mcnamara was a figure who thought in the short term while giáp thought in the long <unk> fog of war : eleven lessons from the life of robert s. mcnamara is a <year> errol morris documentary consisting mostly of interviews with robert mcnamara and archival <unk> . it went on to win the academy award for documentary feature . the particular structure of this personal account is accomplished with the characteristics of an <unk> dialogue . as mcnamara explains , it is a process of examining the experiences of his long and controversial period as the united states secretary of defense , as well as other periods of his personal and public <unk> american <unk> david vine became interested in the subject of expulsion of the chagossians and part of his research tried to contact various american officials . some such as henry kissinger refused to respond , but mcnamara finally left a <unk> message on vine 's phone , saying : `` professor vine , this is robert mcnamara . i do n't believe i can help you . at <integer> , my memory is very , very bad . and i can recall nothing about diego garcia . <unk> you . '' vine returned his call , only for mcnamara to claim that he could not remember discussing with the british the fate of the chagossians , saying `` at <integer> , my memory is bad '' <unk> maintained his involvement in politics in his later years , delivering statements critical of the bush administration 's <year> invasion of iraq . on <month> <integer> , <year> , mcnamara and most living former secretaries of defense and secretaries of state met briefly at the white house with president bush to discuss the war . == personal life == mcnamara married margaret craig , his teenage <unk> , on <month> <integer> , <year>. she was an accomplished cook , and robert 's favorite dish was reputed to be her <unk> <unk> . margaret mcnamara , a former teacher , used her position as a cabinet spouse to launch a reading program for young children , reading is fundamental , which became the largest literacy program in the country . she died of cancer in <year>. later that summer , her ashes were <unk> by her family on a <unk> meadow at <unk> pass , near <unk> village , colorado . the couple had two daughters and a son . the son robert craig mcnamara , who as a student objected to the vietnam war , is now a <unk> and <unk> farmer in california . he is the owner of sierra <unk> in <unk> , california . daughter kathleen mcnamara <unk> is a <unk> with the world bank . the second daughter is margaret elizabeth <unk> the errol morris documentary , mcnamara reports that both he and his wife were <unk> with polio shortly after the end of world war ii . although mcnamara had a relatively short stay in the hospital , his wife 's case was more serious and it was concern over meeting her medical bills that led to his decision to not return to harvard but to enter private industry as a consultant at ford motor company . === at ford === when working at ford motor company , mcnamara <unk> in ann arbor , michigan , rather than the usual auto executive <unk> of <unk> <unk> , birmingham , and <unk> hills . he and his wife sought to remain connected with a university town ( the university of michigan ) after their hopes of returning to harvard after the war were put on hold . === alumnus of the year === in <year> , he was named alumnus of the year by the university of california , berkeley . === attempted assault === on <month> <integer> , <year> , a <unk> on the ferry to martha 's vineyard recognized mcnamara on board and attempted to <unk> him into the ocean . mcnamara declined to press charges . the man remained <unk> but was interviewed years later by author paul <unk> , who quoted the <unk> as saying , `` i just wanted to <unk> ( mcnamara ) on vietnam .

kenneth edwin laurence <unk> simmons ( <integer> <month> <year> – <integer> <month> <year> ) was a respected british ornithologist born in <unk> , middlesex . he spent his early childhood in china and went to school in london , wiltshire and <unk> . he completed professional training for a teachers ’ certificate in <unk> and then took up a teaching post in reading . it was at this time that he took up serious birdwatching and joined the british ornithologists ' union , the royal society for the protection of birds and , a year later , the british trust for ornithology . during a period of national service from <unk> simmons was posted to the suez canal zone , egypt where his observations of birds provided material for later published work . from <year> onwards he published many notes and papers on birds . he became particularly interested in the taxonomic implications of certain simple behaviour patterns and in bird taxonomy generally and was listed in the <year> directory of zoological <unk> . he was also a committee member , joint <unk> and chairman of the reading ornithological club . in <month> <year> he moved to <unk> island , as the island school master , with his wife marion as his assistant . although he had intended to spend his spare time on the island writing , he ended spending most of it observing and studying the brown booby <unk> <unk> . upon their

together with david hunter hubel and torsten <unk> wiesel , won the <year> nobel prize in physiology and medicine for his work with split-brain research . a review of general psychology survey , published in <year> , ranked sperry as the <days> most cited psychologist of the <days> century . == early life and education == sperry was born in hartford , connecticut , to francis <unk> and florence <unk> sperry . his father was in banking , and his mother trained in business school . he was raised in an upper <unk> environment , which stressed academic achievement . roger had one brother , russell <unk> . their father died when roger was <decimal> afterwards , his mother became assistant to the principal in the local high school . sperry went to hall high school in west hartford , connecticut , where he was a star <unk> in several sports , and did well enough academically to win a scholarship to oberlin college . at oberlin , he was captain of the basketball team , and he also took part in <unk> baseball , football , and track . he also worked at a <unk> on campus to help support himself . sperry was an english major , but he took an <unk> to psychology class taught by a professor named r. h. stetson who had worked with william james , the father of american psychology . this class sparked sperry 's interest in the brain and how it can change . stetson was disabled and had trouble getting around so sperry would help him out by driving him to and from wherever he needed to go . this included taking stetson to <unk> with his colleagues . sperry would just sit at the end of the table and listen to stetson and his colleagues discuss their research and other psychological interests . this increased sperry 's interest in psychology even more and after he received his undergraduate degree in english from oberlin he decided to stay and get his master 's degree in psychology . he received his bachelor 's degree in english in <year> and a master 's degree in psychology in <year>. he received his ph.d. in zoology from the university of chicago in <year> , supervised by paul a. <unk> . sperry then did postdoctoral research with karl lashley at harvard university though most of his time was spent with lashley at the yerkes primate research center in orange park , florida . == career == in <year> , sperry began work at the yerkes laboratories of primate biology , then a part of harvard university . there he focused on experiments involving the <unk> of motor and sensory nerves . he left in <year> to become an assistant professor , and later associate professor , at the university of chicago . in <year> , during a routine <unk> x-ray , there was evidence of tuberculosis . he was sent to <unk> lake in the <unk> mountains in new york for treatment . it was during this time when he began writing his concepts of the mind and brain , and was first published in the american scientist in <year>. in <year> , he became the section chief of neurological diseases and <unk> at the national institutes of health and finished out the year at the marine biology laboratory in coral <unk> , <unk> . sperry went back to the university of chicago in <year> and became an associate professor of psychology . he was not offered tenure at chicago and planned to move to bethesda , maryland but was held up by a delay in construction at the national institutes of health . during this time sperry 's friend victor <unk> invited him to lecture about his research at a symposium . there were professors from the california institute of technology in the audience of the symposium who , after listening to sperry 's lecture , were so impressed with him they offered him a job as the <unk> professor of psychobiology . in <year> , he accepted the position as a professor at the california institute of technology ( caltech as <unk> professor of psychobiology ) where he performed his most famous experiments with joseph <unk> , md and many students including michael gazzaniga . under the supervision of paul <unk> while earning his ph.d. at the university of chicago , sperry became interested in neuronal <unk> and brain <unk> and began questioning the existing concepts about these two topics . he asked the simple question first asked in his introduction to psychology class at oberlin : nature or nurture ? he began a series of experiments in an attempt to answer this question . sperry <unk> the motor nerves of rats ' legs so the left nerve controlled the right leg and vice versa . he would then place the rats in a <unk> that had an electric grid on the bottom separated into four sections . each leg of the rat was placed into one of the four sections of the electric grid . a shock was administered to a specific section of the grid , for example the grid where the rat 's left back leg was located would receive a shock . every time the left paw was shocked the rat would lift his right paw and vice versa . sperry wanted to know how long it would take the rat to realize he was <unk> the wrong paw . after repeated tests sperry found that the rats never learned to lift up the correct paw , leading him to the conclusion that some things are just <unk> and can not be <unk> . in sperry 's words , `` no adaptive functioning of the nervous system took place . '' during sperry 's postdoctoral years with karl lashley at harvard and at the yerkes laboratories of primate biology in orange park , florida , he continued his work on neuronal <unk> that he had begun as a doctoral student and initiated a new series of studies involving <unk> . the <unk> nerves were <unk> and the eyes <unk> <integer> degrees . the question was whether vision would be normal after regeneration or would the animal forever view the world as `` upside down '' and <unk> reversed . should the latter prove to be the case , it would mean that the nerves were somehow `` guided '' back to their original sites of <unk> . restoration of normal vision ( i.e. , `` seeing '' the world in a `` <unk> '' orientation ) would mean that the <unk> nerves had <unk> in new sites , quite different from the original ones . the animals reacted as though the world was upside down and reversed from right to left . furthermore , no amount of training could change the response . these studies , which provided strong evidence for nerve guidance by `` intricate chemical codes under genetic control '' ( <year> ) culminated in sperry 's <unk> hypothesis ( <year> ) <unk> later served on the board of trustees and as professor of psychobiology emeritus at california institute of technology . the sperry neuroscience building at oberlin college was named in his honor in <year> . == nobel prize == sperry was granted numerous awards over his lifetime , including the california scientist of the year award in <year> , the national medal of science in <year> , the wolf prize in medicine in <year> , and the albert lasker medical research award in <year> , and the nobel prize for <unk> in <year> that he shared with david h. hubel and torsten n. wiesel . sperry won this award for his work with `` split-brain '' patients . the brain is divided into two hemispheres , the left and right hemispheres , connected in the middle by a part of the brain called the corpus callosum . in `` split-brain '' patients , the corpus callosum has been severed due to the patients suffering from epilepsy , a disease that causes intense and <unk> seizures . seizures begin in one hemisphere and continue into the other hemisphere . cutting the corpus callosum <unk> the seizures from moving from one hemisphere to the other , which then <unk> seizures from occurring , thus allowing the patients to function normally instead of suffering from continuous seizures . sperry first became interested in `` split-brain '' research when he was working on the topic of <unk> transfer , which occurs when `` one <unk> with one eye how to solve a problem then , with that eye covered and using the other eye , one already knows how to solve the problem '' . sperry asked the question : `` how can the learning with one eye appear with the use of the other ? '' sperry cut nerves in the eyes of cats so the left eye was connected to the left hemisphere and the right eye was connected to the right hemisphere ; he also cut the corpus callosum . the cats were then taught to distinguish a triangle from a square with the right eye covered . then the cats were presented the same problem with the left eye covered ; the cats had no idea what they had just learned with the right eye and because of this could be taught to distinguish a square from a triangle . depending on which eye was covered , the cats would either distinguish a square from a triangle or a triangle from a square , demonstrating that the left and right hemispheres learned and remembered two different events . this led sperry to believe that the left and right hemispheres function separately when not connected by the corpus callosum . sperry 's research with `` split-brain '' cats helped lead to the discovery that cutting the corpus callosum is a very effective treatment for patients who suffer from epilepsy . initially after the patients recovered from surgery there were no signs that the surgery caused any changes to their behavior or functioning . this observation rendered the question : if the surgery had absolutely no effect on any part of the patients ' normal functioning then what is the purpose of the corpus callosum ? was it simply there to keep the two sides of the brain from collapsing , as karl lashley jokingly put it ? sperry was asked to develop a series of tests to perform on the `` split-brain '' patients to determine if the surgery caused changes in the patients ' functioning or not . working with his graduate student michael gazzaniga , sperry invited several of the `` split-brain '' patients to volunteer to take part in his study to determine if the surgery affected their functioning . these tests were designed to test the patients ' language , vision , and motor skills . when a person views something in the left visual field ( that is on the left side of their body ) , the information travels to the right hemisphere of the brain and vice versa . in the first series of tests , sperry would present a word to either the left or right visual field for a short period of time . if the word was shown to the right visual field , meaning the left hemisphere would process it , then the patient could report seeing the word . if the word was shown to the left visual field , meaning the right hemisphere would process it , then the patient could not report seeing the word . this led sperry to believe that only the left side of the brain could articulate speech . however , in a follow-up experiment , sperry discovered that the right hemisphere does have some language abilities . in this experiment , he had the patients place their left hands in a <unk> full of objects located under a partition so the patient would not be able to see the objects . then a word was shown to the patient 's left visual field , which was processed by the right side of the brain . this word described one of the objects in the <unk> , so the patient 's left hand picked up the object corresponding to the word . when participants were asked about the word and the object in their hand , they claimed they had not seen the word and had no idea why they were holding the object . the right side of the brain had recognized the word and told the left hand to <unk> it up , but because the right side of the brain can not speak and the left side of the brain had not seen the word , the patient could not articulate what they had seen . in another series of experiments further examining the <unk> of language in the left and right hemispheres , sperry presented one object to the left visual field and a different object to the right visual field of the `` split-brain '' patients . the patient 's left hand was put under a partition and then the patient was asked to draw with their left hand what they had been shown . the patients would draw what they had seen in their left visual field , but when asked what they had drawn would describe what had been shown to their right visual field . these tests proved that when the corpus callosum is severed , it <unk> the connection between the left and right hemispheres , making them unable to communicate with each other . not only are they unable to communicate with each other , but also without the corpus callosum connecting them one hemisphere has no idea that the other hemisphere even exists . there was even evidence of this outside the laboratory when some of the patients reported that , `` while their left hand was <unk> their shirt , the right hand would follow along behind and button it again . '' these experiments were beneficial to numerous people in many different ways . in his words , each hemisphere is : indeed a conscious system in its own right , <unk> , thinking , remembering , reasoning , willing , and <unk> , all at a <unk> human level , and ... both the left and the right hemisphere <month> be conscious simultaneously in different , even in mutually conflicting , mental experiences that run along in parallel this research contributed greatly to understanding the <unk> of brain function . in <year> , sperry also received the national medal of science . afterwards in <year> , sperry received the lifetime achievement award from apa . in addition to his contribution in establishing the <unk> function of the brain , sperry is noted for his `` <unk> hypothesis '' , which has not only been influential in formation of <unk> hypotheses in how precise neuronal <unk> diagram is established in the brain , but the hypothesis itself has been verified by numerous experiments . the cells and <unk> of the brain must carry some kind of individual identification <unk> , presumably <unk> in nature , by which they are distinguished one from another almost , in many regions , to the level of the single neurons in the words of a <year> review article in science magazine : `` he suggested that <unk> of such identification <unk> on <unk> neurons and on the target cells in the brain <unk> guide the <unk> <unk> of millions of developing <unk> axons . this idea was supported by the identification and genetic analysis of axon guidance molecules , including those that direct development of the vertebrate visual system . '' this was confirmed in the seventies by marshall w. <unk> 's work on <unk> <unk> and later on drosophila <unk> <unk> experiments conducted by sperry focused on four major ideas which were also called `` <unk> '' : <unk> , split brain studies , nerve regeneration and plasticity , and psychology of the consciousness . == personal life == in <year> , sperry married <unk> gay <unk> . they had one son , glenn michael , and one daughter , <unk> hope . sperry was a quiet , <unk> , and modest man with an <unk> curiosity . he never stopped working , questioning , or learning up until his death in <year> of als or <unk> <unk> 's disease . sperry could often be found in his office with his feet <unk> up on his desk <unk> in his <unk> or deep in thought . sperry was an avid paleontologist and displayed his large fossil collection in his home . he was also a very talented sculptor , artist , and <unk> . he enjoyed going on camping and fishing trips with his wife and children in <unk> , california . == awards and honors == == bibliography == == references == == external links == roger w. sperry on nobelprize.org < end_of_passage > < start_of_passage > jacob mincer ( <month> <integer> , <year> – <month> <integer> , <year> ) , was a father of modern labor economics . he was joseph l. <unk> professor of economics and social relations at columbia university for most of his active life . == biography == born in <unk> <unk> , poland , mincer survived world war ii prison camps in czechoslovakia and germany as a teenager . after graduating from <unk> university in <year> , mincer received his ph.d. from columbia university in <year> . following teaching <unk> at city college of new york , hebrew university , stockholm school of economics and the university of chicago , mincer joined columbia 's faculty in <year>. he stayed at columbia until his retirement in <year> . mincer was also a member of the national bureau of economic research from <year> through his death . mincer died at his manhattan home on <month> <integer> , <year> , due to complications from parkinson 's disease , according to his wife , dr. flora mincer , and his daughters , deborah mincer ( <unk> ) and <unk> mincer . == contributions to economic science == mincer was considered by many to be a father of modern labor economics . as a leading member of a group of economists known as the chicago school of economics , mincer and nobel laureate gary becker helped to develop the empirical foundations of human capital theory , consequently <unk> the field of labor economics . during his academic career , mincer authored four books and hundreds of journal articles , papers and essays . mincer 's <unk> work : schooling , experience and earnings , published in <year> , used data from the <year> and <year> censuses to relate income distribution in america to the varying amounts of education and <unk> training among workers . `` he calculated , for example , that annual earnings rose by <integer> to <integer> percent in the <year>s and <year>s for every year of additional schooling . there was a similar , although smaller , return on investment in job <unk> age played a role . `` mincer 's work continues to have a profound impact on the field of labor economics . papers in the field frequently use <unk> equations , which model wages as a function of human capital in statistical estimation . and as a result of mincer 's pioneering work , variables such as schooling and work experience are now the most commonly used measures of human capital . == awards and prizes == in <year> mincer was elected as a fellow of the american statistical <unk> <year> , he received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the university of chicago which recognized his seminal work in the economic analysis of earnings and inequality , the labor force decisions of women and of job <unk> . the citation for the degree also recognized mincer 's work in this area that has helped guide a generation of economists who study these important social questions . in recognition of his lifetime achievements in economics , mincer was awarded the first <unk> prize in labor economics of the institute for the study of labor ( bonn , germany ) . the $ <other>0,000 prize was presented to mincer by more than <integer> of his former students and colleagues at a conference at columbia university in <year> . in <year> mincer received a career achievement award from the society of labor economists ;

idea that shifting one 's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects , such as correlations with mental illness . == life == aschoff was born in freiburg im breisgau as the fifth child of the pathologist ludwig aschoff ( known for discovering the <unk> or <unk> <unk> ) and his wife clara . he grew up in the liberal but morally strict world of prussian academia . after the abitur at a humanistic high school , he – according to his own statement `` lacking a specific interest '' – studied medicine at the university of bonn , where he joined the <unk> ( fraternity ) <unk> bonn . aschoff ’ s scientific career began in <year> , when he moved to the university of göttingen to study thermoregulation physiology with hermann rein . in <year> , he received the <unk> <unk> . he then became a professor at the university of göttingen in <year>.in <year> , his mentor , hermann rein , was appointed director of the max planck institute for medical research in heidelberg . rein brought aschoff to the institute as a collaborator to study circadian rhythms in humans , birds , and mice . aschoff then moved to the max planck institute for behavioral physiology in <unk> to work with gustav kramer , who showed <unk> <unk> navigation in birds , and erich von <unk> , who studied physiological oscillators . from <year> to <year> , he was a director at the max planck institute for behavioral physiology and an extraordinary professor in munich . aschoff was a scientific member and a member of the <unk> of the max planck institute for behavior physiology , as well as senator of the max planck society from <year> to <year> . aschoff was known as an excellent lecturer with a <unk> voice , and he took a special interest in creating a scientific community and encouraging young scientists . after his retirement in <year> and return to freiburg , aschoff continued his scientific work in the form of further publications . only the death of his wife <unk> broke his unusual <unk> . jürgen aschoff died ten months after his wife in <year> , after a short illness at the age of <integer> years . == work == aschoff provided a strong foundation for the field of chronobiology through his research on circadian rhythms and entrainment in many different organisms such as rats , mice , birds , macaques , monkeys , and humans . his early research focused on understanding the properties of circadian rhythms and how these rhythms can change in response to stimuli . his later work was more applicable to <unk> , such as psychiatric disorders and dangers of shift work schedules , which can result from <unk> specific <unk> . aschoff 's work in the field of chronobiology introduced the idea that shifting one 's light-dark cycle can result in harmful effects , such as correlations with mental illness . === early work === aschoff began his research on the physiology of thermoregulation by <unk> . he discovered that there was a <unk> rhythm of variation in body temperature . after these experiments , he began investigating the basic mechanisms of circadian rhythm . in the <year>s , he met and began to collaborate with erwin <unk> and colin pittendrigh . aschoff began further experimentation studying the circadian rhythms of birds and mice under constant conditions . his results led to the conclusion that circadian <unk> of biological processes were innate and did not require prior exposure to a <unk> day to be <unk> also applied these methods to experiments with human circadian rhythms by building an underground `` bunker '' to isolate human subjects from any external environmental cues . subjects placed in this bunker were allowed to turn <unk> on or off according to their own internal rhythms . after over twenty years of tracking <unk> cycles , body temperature , urine output , and other physiological and behavioral outputs , aschoff and his collaborator <unk> <unk> concluded that humans have endogenous circadian oscillators . this discovery has become the foundation for our understanding of many medical problems such as <unk> , sleep disorders , and jet <unk> <year> , aschoff coined the term zeitgeber ( from german for `` time <unk> '' or `` <unk> '' ) to refer to external , environmental cues that <unk> an endogenous <unk> to the environmental cycle . to investigate the properties of natural endogenous oscillators , aschoff exposed organisms to constant conditions without zeitgeber cues ( either constant light or constant darkness ) . the observations from this paper were formulated into the fundamental rules of biological clocks . === aschoff 's rule === from the experiments communicated in <year> , aschoff noted that under constant light conditions , the activity phase <unk> in nocturnal organisms and <unk> in <unk> organisms . these trends were termed alpha <unk> and alpha expansion , respectively . in tribute to his mentor , pittendrigh called this observation `` aschoff 's rule '' in a <year> publication , and the designation remains <unk> 's rule is related to the model of parametric entrainment , which <unk> continuous phase changes . aschoff and pittendrigh approached the field with different models of how oscillators <unk> , which resulted in different <unk> models . aschoff 's parametric model states that entrainment occurs through gradual changes in the clock that adapt to a new light-dark cycle . although this is no longer recognized as the correct model in the field , serge daan suggested in <year> that aschoff made qualitative contributions that provide valuable alternatives to <unk> in the current field . === later work === much of aschoff 's later work involved tests on human subjects . he found that the absence of a light-dark cycle does not prevent humans from entrainment . rather , knowing the time of day from social cues , such as regular meal times , is sufficient for entrainment . aschoff also found that different circadian outputs such as body temperature and <unk> activity can be either internally <unk> or <unk> depending on the strength of the zeitgeber . in constant darkness , <unk> temperature and sleep onset and duration became <unk> in some subjects , and the <unk> temperature at the time of sleep onset was correlated to the duration of the <unk> of sleep . he hypothesized that internal <unk> , the phase differences resulting from period differences between two circadian output processes , could be related to many psychiatric <unk> of aschoff 's later work also integrated his initial interest in thermoregulation with his work on circadian rhythm . he found a circadian rhythm in thermal conductance , a measurement of heat transfer from the body . minimal conductance in mammals and birds <unk> with circadian phase , with a wide range of conductance values . this allows animals to release heat during their activity period , when they have higher basal metabolism , as well as <unk> heat during their rest period , when they have lower basal metabolism . in birds , the circadian rhythm in conductance results mostly from circadian rates of <unk> heat loss . in mammals , the conductance <unk> with circadian rhythms in the body 's heat resistance and blood flow <unk> up on his temperature studies , he found that a mammalian species can <unk> to a temperature cycle , but that temperature is a weak

parametric entrainment is entrainment that does not result from an <unk> change in phase , as governed by a phase response curve , as in the case of masking signals . the term aschoff used for this phenomenon is “ <unk> ” due to <unk> <unk> . data from experimental <unk> show a relationship between masking effects and phase , leading to a “ <unk> ” effect whereby animals <unk> in constant

'' === kantrowitz limit === kantrowitz is known for development of a theoretical concept of fluid <unk> points at supersonic and <unk> inlet velocities . the concept has become known as the kantrowitz limit . ==== technical description ==== ==== applications ==== the kantrowitz limit has many applications in the gas dynamics of inlet flow for jet engines and rockets , both when operating at <unk> and supersonic velocities . two examples will explain the effect of the kantrowitz limit on a nozzle . for both cases , mass flow rate = inlet velocity multiplied by area multiplied by density . consider a nozzle connected to a <unk> source . as the pressure ratio gets to about <integer> , the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound , and the flow becomes choked flow . when the absolute pressure of the <unk> is decreased further , the flow speed will not increase . this is the kantrowitz limit , which limits the mass flow because the velocity is limited to the speed of sound , and the area , inlet pressure and density are all fixed . aircraft jet engines are very much affected by this limit , once the inlet flow speed gets to mach <integer> the mass flow rate is limited , regardless of how much <unk> the engine creates . next , consider the nozzle connected to a <unk> air supply . with a pressure ratio of about <integer> , the flow becomes choked , and can not <unk> the speed of sound . but the density and resultant mass flow rate can be increased by increasing the inlet pressure . the greater the pressure , the greater the density , and the greater the mass flow . so , while kantrowitz limits the maximum gas velocity , it does not apply any fixed limit to the mass flow rate . a recent high-speed transportation option for rapid transit between <unk> <unk> about <other>,000 miles ( <unk> km ) apart , the hyperloop , has the kantrowitz limit as a fundamental design criterion . attempting to pass a high-speed <unk> through a very low pressure <unk> runs <unk> into the kantrowitz fluid flow limit . historically , the solutions to working within the limit have been `` go fast '' and `` go slow '' . a major innovation in the hyperloop proposal provides a novel third approach to remain below the kantrowitz limit while still moving at <unk> velocities : adding a <unk> inlet <unk> to actively transfer <unk> air from the front to the <unk> of the high-speed transport capsule , and thus <unk> much of the air that would have resulted in the dynamic shock of the choked flow . the flow in the smaller <unk> through the capsule is also subject to the kantrowitz limit , this is relieved by increasing the pressure and the density to achieve the required mass flow . in the hyperloop alpha design of <year> , the <unk> pump also provides a <unk> <unk> <unk> system for traveling at over <integer> <unk> ( <other>,100 <unk> ) . == honors and awards == kantrowitz was a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences , american association for the advancement of science , american astronautical society , american institute of aeronautics and astronautics ( honorary ) , american physical society , american institute for medical and biological engineering and member of the national academy of engineering and national academy of sciences and international academy of astronautics . in <unk> , he held both fulbright and guggenheim fellowships at cambridge and manchester universities . kantrowitz was an honorary trustee of the university of rochester , an honorary life member of the board of governors of the technion , and an honorary professor of the <unk> institute of technology , <unk> , china . kantrowitz also served on the board of advisors for the foresight institute , an organization devoted to preparing for nanotechnology . kantrowitz held <integer> patents and wrote or co-authored more than <integer> scientific and professional papers and articles . he also co-authored fundamentals of gas dynamics , <year> , princeton univ . press . kantrowitz died at age <integer> , <month> <integer> , <year> , while visiting relatives in new york . he had suffered a heart attack on the previous day . == see also == hyperloop <unk> competition – practical ground transport vehicle prototypes dealing with the kantrowitz limit == references == `` biographies of aerospace officials and policymakers , <unk> '' . nasa history division . archived from the original on <integer> <month> <year>. retrieved <unk> . johnson , john , jr.

and began his career as a tax inspector , before becoming a trade union official in the <year>s ; he served as a lieutenant in the royal navy during the second world war . he was elected to parliament at the <year> election , and was regarded as being on the left wing of the labour party . he was appointed to the attlee government as a parliamentary secretary in <year> , and began to move increasingly towards the right wing of the labour party , while maintaining his reputation as a `` keeper of the <unk> <unk> '' – that is , seen as maintaining close ties between labour and the trade unions . following labour 's defeat at the <year> election , callaghan increasingly became regarded as the leader of the right wing of the labour party , and stood for the positions of deputy leader in <year> and for leader in <year> , but was defeated by george brown for the former and harold wilson for the latter . following labour 's victory at the <year> election , wilson appointed callaghan as chancellor of the exchequer ; this appointment coincided with a turbulent period for the british economy , during which callaghan had to tackle both a chronic balance of payments deficit and various speculative attacks on the pound sterling , with its exchange rate to other <unk> being fixed by the bretton woods system . on <integer> <month> <year> , having initially denied that it would

winning a narrow majority in the house of commons at the <year> election , labour had lost this by the time callaghan became prime minister , and several by-election <unk> and <unk> in his early months forced callaghan to strike a confidence and supply agreement with the liberal party . while this initially proved stable , in the wake of significant industrial disputes and widespread strikes in the <year>–79 `` winter of discontent '' , and the defeat of the referendum on devolution for scotland , led to minor parties joining the conservatives to pass a motion of no-confidence in callaghan on <integer> <month> <year>. although remaining personally popular in opinion polls , callaghan led labour to defeat at the <year> election and was replaced by margaret thatcher . callaghan initially remained as labour leader , serving as leader of the opposition until <month> <year>. he attempted to reform the process by which labour elected its leader . after leaving the leadership , he returned to the <unk> , and between <year> and <year> was father of the house of commons . on retiring from the commons in <year> , he was elevated to the house of lords as baron callaghan of

several times to study and lecture at the lse . following the outbreak of world war ii callaghan applied to join the royal navy in <year> , but was initially turned down on the basis that a trade union official was deemed to be a reserved occupation . he was finally allowed to join the royal navy volunteer reserve as an ordinary <unk> in <year>. while he trained for his promotion his medical

appointed parliamentary secretary to the ministry of transport in <year> where , advised by the young chief <unk> of hertfordshire , sir arthur young , his term saw important improvements in road

callaghan ran to succeed him , but came third in the leadership contest , which was won by harold wilson . however , he did gain the support of <unk> , such as denis healey and anthony <unk> , who wanted to prevent wilson from being elected leader but who also did not trust george brown . === chancellor of the exchequer , <year>–1967 === in <month> <year> , conservative prime minister sir alec <unk> ( who had only been in power for twelve months since the resignation of harold macmillan ) was forced to call a general election , the parliament being about to <unk> . labour won a narrow majority , gaining <integer> seats for a total of <integer> to the conservatives ' <decimal> the new labour government under harold wilson immediately faced economic problems ; wilson acted within his first hours to appoint callaghan as the new chancellor of the exchequer . the previous chancellor , reginald <unk> , had initiated <unk> expansionary measures which had helped create a <unk> economic boom ; by greatly increasing domestic demand this had caused imports to grow much faster than exports , thus when labour entered government they faced a balance of payments deficit of <unk> ( equivalent to <unk> in <year> ) , and an immediate sterling crisis . both wilson and callaghan took a strong stance against devaluation of sterling , partly due to the perception that the devaluation carried out by the previous labour government in <year> had contributed to that government 's <unk> . the alternative to devaluation , however , was a series of <unk> measures designed to reduce demand in the economy in order to reduce imports , and to stabilise the balance of payments and the value of sterling . just ten days after taking up his post , callaghan immediately introduced a <integer> % <unk> on imports , with the exception of <unk> and raw materials . this measure was intended to tackle the balance of payments deficit ; however , it caused an uproar amongst britain 's international trading partners . the <unk> was so intense that it caused the government to announce that the <unk> was a temporary measure . callaghan later admitted in his autobiography that he could have handled the matter better , and in his <unk> to tackle the balance of payments problem , had failed to <unk> foreign <unk> <integer> <month> , callaghan gave his first budget and announced increases in income tax , <unk> tax and the introduction of a new capital gains tax , actions which most economists deemed necessary to take the heat out of the balance and sterling deficit . in line with labour 's manifesto commitments , the budget also contained social measures to increase the state pension and the <unk> pension ; measures which were disliked by the city and <unk> , causing a run on the pound . on <integer> <month> , it was decided to increase the bank rate from <integer> % to <integer> % , which generated a large amount of criticism . handling the situation was made more difficult by the attitude of lord <unk> , the governor of the bank of england , who argued against the fiscal policies of the new labour government . when callaghan and wilson threatened to call a new general election , the governor soon raised a <unk> loan to stabilise the reserves and the <unk> second budget came on <integer> <month> <year> , in which he announced efforts to <unk> the economy and reduce home import demand by <unk> . shortly afterwards , the bank rate was reduced from <integer> % down to <integer> % . for a brief time , the economy and british financial market <unk> , allowing in <month> for callaghan to visit the united states and to discuss the state of the british economy with president lyndon b. johnson and the international monetary fund ( imf ) .in <month> , the pound came under extreme pressure and callaghan was forced to create harsh temporary measures to demonstrate control of the economy . these include <unk> all current government building projects and <unk> new pension plans . the alternative was to allow the pound to <unk> or to <unk> it . callaghan and wilson , however , were again adamant that a devaluation of the pound would create new social and economic problems and continued to take a firm stance against it . the government continued to struggle both with the economy and with the <unk> majority which , by <year> , had been reduced to one . on <integer> <month> , harold wilson formally announced an election for <integer> <month> <year>. on <integer> <month> , callaghan gave a <unk> budget ' to the commons and announced the historic decision that the uk would adopt decimal currency . ( it was actually not until <year> , under a conservative government , that the united kingdom moved from the system of pounds , <unk> and <unk> to a decimal system of <integer> <unk> to the pound . ) he also announced a short-term mortgage scheme which allowed <unk> earners to maintain mortgage schemes in the face of economic difficulties . soon afterwards , at the <year> general election , labour won <integer> seats compared to <integer> seats against the conservatives , giving the labour government an increased majority of <integer> <unk> introduced his next budget on <integer> <month> . he had informed the house that he would bring a full budget to the house when he made his <unk> budget ' speech prior to the election . the main point of his budget was the introduction of a selective employment tax , <unk> the service industry and <unk> the manufacturing industry . twelve days after the budget , the national union of <unk> called a national strike and the problems facing sterling were multiplied . additional strikes caused the balance of payments deficit to increase . however , a <unk> loan from swiss banks was due by the end of the year . on <integer> <month> , the bank rate was increased again to seven percent , and on <integer> <month> callaghan announced a <unk> emergency package to deal with the crisis which included further tax rises and a <unk> freeze on wage increases . by early <year> , the economy had begun to stabilise once again with the balance of payments moving into equilibrium , the bank rate was reduced to <integer> % in <month> and <decimal> % in <unk> was under these conditions that callaghan beat michael foot in a vote to become treasurer of the labour party . the economy was soon in turmoil again by <month> , with the six-day war in the middle east . several arab countries , such as kuwait and iraq , announced an oil <unk> against britain , accusing it of intervening on the israeli side in the conflict , resulting in a rise in oil prices which had a disastrous effect on the balance of payments . furthermore , the economy was hit in mid-<month> when a national <unk> strike lasted for eight weeks . the final <unk> , however , was an eec report which suggested that the pound could not be sustained as a reserve currency and it was suggested again that the pound should be devalued . callaghan responded by pointing out that , had it not been for the middle east crisis , britain would have been heading for a balance of payments surplus in <year>. however , rumours that devaluation was on the cards led to heavy selling of sterling on world markets . wilson and callaghan refused a <unk> fund offered from the imf because of several conditions attached which they believed would allow the imf to interfere with economic policy . on <dayofweek> <integer> <month> , the historic decision was taken to commit the government to a <decimal> % devaluation from the existing fixed exchange rate of $ <decimal> to the pound , to $ <decimal> to the pound . they intended to announce the decision publicly on the <days> . however , in the run up to the public announcement , callaghan found himself in a <unk> situation when answering questions in the house of commons : one backbencher robert sheldon tabled a motion concerning a <unk> that britain would be receiving a loan from banks . callaghan did not wish to lie to the commons , but at the same time going public about the devaluation decision before the <days> would be financially disastrous for the country . he answered the initial question by stating that he did not comment on rumours . however a follow up question was made by <unk> <unk> suggesting that devaluation was <unk> to <unk> , which caused a major problem . callaghan replied that he had `` nothing to add or <unk> from , anything i have said on previous occasions on the subject of devaluation '' ... <unk> seized on the fact that he had not denied there would be a devaluation and started selling sterling . over the next <integer> hours , the flight from sterling cost the country <unk> million . the situation was a great political controversy at the time . as denis healey in his autobiography notes : <unk> exchange rates can <unk> to and <unk> <unk> by amount greater than that , without attracting much attention outside the city columns of the newspapers . it <month> be difficult to understand how great a political <unk> this devaluation appeared at the <unk> all to wilson and his chancellor , jim callaghan , who felt he must resign over it . callaghan 's personal distress was increased by a <unk> answer he gave to a backbencher 's question two days before the formal devaluation . this cost britain several hundred million pounds . before the devaluation , jim callaghan had announced publicly to the press and the house of commons that he would not <unk> , something he later said was necessary to maintain confidence in the pound and avoid creating <unk> in the financial markets . callaghan immediately offered his resignation as chancellor , and increasing political opposition forced wilson to accept it . wilson then moved roy jenkins , the home secretary , to be chancellor ; callaghan became the new home secretary on <integer> <month> <year> . === home secretary , <year>–1970 === callaghan 's tenure as home secretary was marked by the emerging conflict in northern ireland and it was as home secretary that he took the decision to <unk> british army troops in the province after a request from the <unk> <unk> government of northern ireland . callaghan was also responsible for the commonwealth immigrants act <year> , a controversial piece of legislation prompted by conservative <unk> that an influx of kenyan asians would soon <unk> the country . it passed through the commons in a week and placed entry controls on holders of british <unk> who had `` no substantial connection '' with britain by setting up a new system . in his memoirs time and chance , callaghan wrote that introducing the commonwealth immigrants bill had been an <unk> task but that he did not regret it . he said the asians had `` discovered a <unk> '' and he told a bbc interviewer : `` public opinion in this country was extremely <unk> , and the consideration that was in my mind was how we could preserve a proper sense of order in this country and , at the same time , do justice to these <unk> had to balance both considerations '' . an opponent of the act , conservative mp ian <unk> , said that it was `` brought in to keep the <unk> out . if it had been the case that it was <other>,000 white <unk> who were coming in , the newspapers and politicians , callaghan included , who were making all the <unk> would have been quite pleased '' <unk> significant was the passing of the race relations act in the same year , making it illegal to <unk> employment , housing or education on the basis of ethnic background . the act extended the powers of the race relations board at the time , to deal with complaints of discrimination and unfair attitudes . it also set up a new <unk> body , the community relations commission , to promote `` <unk> community relations '' . presenting the bill to parliament , callaghan said : `` the house has rarely faced an issue of greater social significance for our country and our children . '' in <year> , callaghan , a strong supporter of the <unk> union link , led the successful opposition in a divided cabinet to barbara castle 's white paper `` in place of <unk> '' which sought to modify trade union law . amongst its numerous proposals were plans to force unions to call a ballot before a strike was held and the establishment of an industrial board to enforce settlements in industrial disputes . if the proposals had become law , many of the activities of the trades unions during the winter of discontent a decade later would have been illegal . following wilson 's unexpected defeat by edward heath at the <year> general election , callaghan declined to challenge him for the leadership , despite wilson 's <unk> . this did much to <unk> him in wilson 's eyes . he was in charge of drawing up a new policy statement in <year> which contained the idea of the social contract between the government and trade unions . he also did much to ensure that labour opposed the heath government 's bid to enter the common <unk> wilson 's hand by making his personal opposition clear without consulting the party leader . === foreign secretary , <year>–1976 === when wilson won the next general election and returned as prime minister in <month> <year> , he appointed callaghan as foreign secretary which gave him responsibility for <unk> the terms of the united kingdom 's membership of the common market . when the talks concluded , callaghan led the cabinet in declaring the new terms <unk> and he supported a `` yes '' vote in the <year> referendum . he was awarded the freedom of the city of cardiff on <integer> <month> <year> . ==== <year> leadership election ==== barely two years after beginning his second spell as prime minister , wilson announced his surprise resignation on <integer> <month> <year> , and <unk> endorsed callaghan as his successor . callaghan was the favourite to win the leadership election ; although he was the oldest candidate , he was also the most experienced and least divisive . popularity with all parts of the labour movement saw him through the ballot of labour mps to win the leadership vote . on <integer> <month> <year> , at the age of <integer> years and <integer> days , callaghan became prime <unk> oldest prime minister at time of appointment since winston churchill . == prime minister of the united kingdom : <year>–1979 == callaghan was the only prime minister to have held all three leading cabinet <unk> of the exchequer , home secretary and foreign <unk> to becoming prime minister . during his first year in office , callaghan started what has since become known as 'the great debate ' , when he spoke at ruskin college , oxford , about the <unk> concerns ' of the public about the quality of education in the nation 's maintained schools . this discussion led to greater involvement of the government , through its ministries , in the curriculum and administration of state education , leading to the eventual introduction of the national curriculum some ten years later . early in his premiership he caused controversy with the appointment of peter jay , his then <unk> as the british ambassador to the united states . callaghan 's time as prime minister was dominated by the <unk> in running a government with a minority in the house of commons : he was forced to make deals with minor parties to <unk> the <unk> pact , and he had been forced to accept a referendum on devolution in scotland as well as one in wales ( the former went in favour but did not reach the required majority , and the latter went heavily against ) . he also became prime minister at a time when britain was suffering from <unk> percentage inflation and rising unemployment . he responded to the economic crises by <unk> <unk> policies to reduce inflation , and cutting public <unk> precursor to the monetarist economic policies that the next government , a conservative one led by margaret thatcher , would pursue to ease the <unk> the economic difficulties faced by the government , over the summer of <year> ( shortly after the end of the <unk> pact ) most opinion polls showed labour ahead , and the expectation grew that callaghan would call an autumn election that would have given him a second term in office until autumn <year>. the economy had also started to show signs of recovery by this time . <year> was a year of economic recovery for britain , with inflation falling to single <unk> , unemployment declining during the year , and general living standards going up by more than <integer> % . famously , he <unk> along the opposition and was expected to make his declaration of election in a broadcast on <integer> <month> <year>. his decision to put off the election was seen by many at the time as a sign of his domination of the political scene and he ridiculed his opponents by singing <unk> music hall star <unk> victoria 's song `` waiting at the church '' at that month 's trades union congress meeting . this was celebrated at the time but has since been interpreted as one of the greatest moments of <unk> in modern british politics . callaghan intended to <unk> the message that he had not promised an election , but most observers <unk> his message as an assertion that he would call an election , and the conservatives would not be ready for it . === winter of discontent === callaghan 's method of dealing with the long-term economic difficulties involved pay restraint which had been operating for four years with reasonable success . he <unk> that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in <year> , and so attempted to hold pay rises to <integer> % or less . the trade unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of <year>–79 ( known as the winter of discontent ) secured higher pay . the industrial unrest made his government extremely unpopular , and callaghan 's response to one interview question only made it worse . returning to the united kingdom from a summit held in <unk> in <month> <year> , callaghan was asked , `` what is your general approach , in view of the mounting chaos in the country at the moment ? '' callaghan replied , `` well , that 's a judgement that you are making . i promise you that if you look at it from outside , and perhaps you 're taking rather a <unk> view at the moment , i do n't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos . '' this reply was reported in the sun under the headline `` crisis ? what crisis ? '' . callaghan also later admitted in regard to the winter of discontent that he had `` let the country down '' .the winter of discontent saw labour 's performance in the opinion polls <unk> dramatically . they had <unk> most of the <unk> opinion polls by several points , but in <month> <year> at least one opinion poll was showing the <unk> <integer> points ahead of labour and it appeared certain that labour would lose the forthcoming <unk> the buildup to the election , the daily mirror and the guardian supported labour , while the sun , the daily mail , the daily express , and the daily telegraph supported the conservatives . on <integer> <month> <year> , the house of commons passed a motion of no-confidence by one vote , <unk> , which forced callaghan to call a general election that was held on <integer> <month> . the conservatives under margaret thatcher ran a campaign on the slogan `` labour is n't working '' and won the election . callaghan agreed to a proposal by brian <unk> , a former labour mp who was by then a broadcaster , to take part in two televised debates with margaret thatcher to be produced by <unk> with the intention that they would be broadcast on itv on <integer> & <integer> <month> <year>. at the insistence of the liberal party , their leader david steel was also invited to take participate in the <unk> debates , and he also quickly accepted the offer . however mrs thatcher ultimately rejected the approach to take part in the debates , citing among other reasons her belief that the election was for a government , not a president . her <unk> meant that the debates did not go <unk> 's failure to call an election during <year> was widely seen as a political <unk> ; indeed , he himself later admitted that not calling an election was an error of judgement . however , private <unk> by the labour party in the autumn of <year> had shown the two main parties with about the same level of support . after losing power in <year> , labour spent the next <integer> years in opposition . historians alan <unk> and chris cook have <unk> the general consensus of historians regarding labour in power in the <year>s : if wilson 's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure , that sense of failure was <unk> reinforced by callaghan 's term as premier . labour , it seemed , was <unk> of positive achievements . it was unable to control inflation , unable to control the unions , unable to solve the irish problem , unable to solve the <unk> question , unable to secure its proposals for welsh and scottish devolution , unable to reach a popular <unk> <unk> with the common market , unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing . it was little wonder , therefore , that mrs thatcher <unk> defeated it in <year> . == resignation , <unk> and retirement == <unk> electoral defeat , callaghan stayed on as labour leader until <integer> <month> <year> , shortly after the party conference had voted for a new system of election by electoral college involving the individual members and trade unions . his resignation ensured that his successor would be elected by mps only . following a campaign that laid bare the deep internal divisions of the parliamentary labour party , michael foot narrowly defeated denis healey on <integer> <month> in the second round of the election to succeed callaghan as party leader . foot had been a relatively late <unk> to the contest and his decision to stand ended the chances of peter shore . in <year> , along with his friend gerald ford , he co-founded the annual <unk> world <unk> <year> , he attacked labour 's plans to reduce defence , and the same year became father of the house as the longest <unk> member of the commons . in <year> , he was made a knight of the <unk> and stood down at the <year> general election after <integer> years as an mp . he was one of the last remaining mps elected in the labour landslide of <year>. shortly afterwards , he was elevated to the house of lords on <integer> <month> <year> as a life peer with the title baron callaghan of cardiff , of the city of cardiff in the county of south <unk> . in <year> , his autobiography , time and chance , was published . he also served as a <unk> director of the bank of wales . his wife audrey , a former chairman ( <year>–82 ) of great <unk> street hospital , spotted a letter to a newspaper which pointed out that the copyright of peter pan , which had been assigned by j. m. barrie to the hospital , was going to <unk> at the end of that year , <year> ( <integer> years after barrie 's death , the <unk> copyright term ) . in <year> , callaghan moved an <unk> to the copyright designs & patents act , then under consideration in the house of lords , to grant the hospital a right to <unk> in <unk> despite the <unk> of copyright , and it was passed by the government . tony benn recorded in his diary entry of <integer> <month> <year> that during the <year> general election campaign , callaghan was <unk> by a volunteer at labour headquarters asking him if he would be willing to become more active in the party . according to benn : one young woman in her <unk> rang up jim callaghan and said to him on the phone , `` have you ever thought of being a bit more active in politics ? '' so callaghan said , `` well i was a labour prime minister – what more could i do ? '' during an interview broadcast on the bbc radio <integer> programme the human button , callaghan became the only prime minister to go on record with his opinion on ordering a retaliation in the event of a nuclear attack on the united kingdom : '' if it were to become necessary or vital , it would have meant the <unk> had failed , because the value of the nuclear weapon is frankly only as a <unk> '' , he said . `` but if we had got to that point , where it was , i felt , necessary to do it , then i would have done it . i 've had terrible doubts , of course , about this . i say to you , if i had lived after having pressed that button , i could never , ever have <unk> myself . '' in <month> <year> , callaghan told the <unk> magazine that he would not be surprised to be considered as britain 's worst prime minister in <integer> years . he also said in this interview that he `` must carry the can '' for the winter of discontent . == personal life == callaghan 's interests included rugby ( he played <unk> for <unk> <unk> before the second world war ) , tennis and agriculture . he married audrey elizabeth <unk> , whom he had met when they both worked as <dayofweek> school teachers at the local baptist church , in <month> <year> and had three <unk> son and two daughters . margaret , baroness jay of <unk> , who married first peter jay and later professor mike adler . julia , who married ian hamilton <unk> and settled in lancashire michael , who married <unk> morris and settled in <unk> there is much doubt about how much belief callaghan retained into adult life , the baptist <unk> <unk> was a profound influence throughout all of his public and private life . like his labour party leader successors michael foot and neil <unk> , callaghan was acknowledged to have been an atheist , and was said to have lost belief in god while he was working as a trade union <unk> of his final public appearances came on <integer> <month> <year> , when shortly after his <days> birthday , he sat alongside the <unk> minister tony <unk> and three other surviving former prime ministers at the time – edward heath , margaret thatcher and john major at buckingham palace for a dinner which formed part of the celebrations for the golden jubilee of elizabeth ii , alongside his daughter margaret , baroness jay , who had served as leader of the house of lords from <year> until <year> . == death == callaghan died on <integer> <month> <year> at his home in <unk> , east sussex , of <unk> pneumonia , cardiac failure and kidney failure , the day before his <days> birthday . he died just <integer> days after his wife of <integer> years , who had spent the last four years of her life in a nursing home due to alzheimer 's disease . he died as britain 's <unk> former prime minister , having surpassed harold macmillan 's record <integer> days <unk> callaghan was cremated , and his ashes were <unk> in a <unk> around the base of the peter pan statue near the entrance of london 's great <unk> street hospital , where his wife had formerly been chair of the board of <unk> order of the <unk> banner was transferred from st george 's chapel , <unk> castle to <unk> cathedral in cardiff following his death . == historiography == his contribution and legacy are still <unk> . the left-wing of the labour party considers him a <unk> whose <unk> of true socialism laid the foundations for <unk> . they point to his decision in <year> to allow the imf to control the government budget . they accuse him of abandoning the traditional labour commitment to full employment . they blame his rigorous pursuit of a policy of controlling income growth for the winter of discontent . writers on the right of the labour party complained that he was a weak leader who was unable to stand up to the left . the new labour writers who <unk> tony <unk> identify him with the <unk> partisanship that was a dead end which a new generation of <unk> had to <unk> all commentators agree that callaghan made a serious mistake by not calling an election in the autumn of <year>. bernard <unk> , a senior official in his government , depicts callaghan as a strong and efficient administrator who stood heads above his predecessor harold wilson . the standard scholarly biography by kenneth o. morgan is generally <unk> least for the middle of his <unk> admitting failures at the beginning , at the end and in his leadership role following margaret thatcher 's victory . the treatment found in most textbooks and surveys of the period remains largely negative . == arms == == see also == <year> uk sterling crisis shadow cabinet of james callaghan == references == ===

with incredible coordination . these are cipolla 's five fundamental laws of stupidity : always and inevitably , everyone <unk> the number of stupid individuals in circulation . the probability that a certain person ( will ) be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person . a stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly <unk> losses . <unk> people always <unk> the damaging power of stupid individuals . in particular , <unk> people constantly forget that at all times and places , and under any circumstances , to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake . a stupid person is the most dangerous type of <unk> : a stupid person is more dangerous than a <unk> . as is evident from the third law , cipolla identifies two factors to consider when exploring human behavior : benefits and losses that an individual causes to him or herself . benefits and losses that an individual causes to <unk> creating a <unk> with the first factor on the <unk> and the second on the <unk> , we obtain four groups of people , with an additional category ( <unk>

bandits '' and `` naïve people '' by noting that members of these groups can either add to or <unk> from the general welfare , depending on the relative gains ( or losses ) that they cause themselves and society . a bandit <month> <unk> himself more or less than he <unk> society , and a naïve person <month> <unk> society more or less than he <unk> himself and/or allows himself to be impoverished . <unk> , this idea is represented by a line of slope <unk> , which <unk> the second and fourth <unk> and <unk> the <unk> at the origin . the <unk> people to the left of this line are thus `` <unk> '' because their conduct <unk> a net <unk> of societal welfare ; some bandits <month> fit this description as well , although many bandits such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> `` <unk> '' and <unk> <month>

for the people . minton 's campaign focused on the achievements of the new deal programs . he claimed farm income in indiana had doubled since <year> , and highlighted the passage of the old age pension laws . his support for conscription and military <unk> for the coming war proved unpopular with voters and cost him considerable support , but according to historian william radcliff it was willkie 's favorite son status , which led many <unk> to vote republican , that proved to be the election 's deciding factor . despite minton 's heavy campaigning , he lost the close election to willis by <unk> votes out of over <decimal> million <unk> won the <year> presidential election . after minton left office in <month> <year> , he was given a position in the roosevelt administration as a reward for his loyalty during the court packing failure . he served as one of the president 's advisers and a liaison between the white house and congress . the extent of his duties is not fully known ; linda gugin has speculated that he <month> have managed roosevelt 's patronage system . minton was responsible for getting several officials appointed to high offices in the federal bureaucracy and numerous others appointed to lower ranking positions . he also convinced roosevelt to support the creation of a senate defense committee chaired by truman , a position that brought truman into the national <unk> and helped him gain the vice presidency . == seventh circuit == === appointment === on <month> <integer> , <year> , roosevelt announced minton 's nomination to the <unk> united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit . minton was confirmed unanimously by the senate on <month> <integer> , <year> , and received his commission on <month> <integer> , <year>. minton resigned from his post in the administration , but even after he began working on the court , minton remained active in democratic politics behind the scenes and was in regular correspondence with roosevelt to make patronage <unk> took his <unk> of office on <month> <integer> , <year> , but the court was in <unk> at the time . he took his seat when it returned to session on <month> <integer> , <year>. the court had the highest court load of all the appellate courts in the nation at that time , <unk> <integer> cases per judge annually . the men on the court were close friends , and minton developed a particularly close friendship with judge j. earl major ; major offered minton financial assistance during his later <unk> . major had been on the court for several years and held a judicial philosophy similar to minton 's . the two men regularly attended baseball games and were frequent guests in each other 's <unk> war ii broke out shortly after minton joined the court , creating a flood of cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance , including challenges to wartime measures , selective service laws , price controls , rationing and civil liberties . in the majority of these cases , the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts , but in several the court was required to establish a precedent . minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to <unk> the decisions of the lower courts . he believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts ' decisions . he believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake . === jurisprudence === minton was described by william radcliff as a `` <unk> <unk> of judicial restraint , '' an unexpected development when compared to his <unk> partisan political career . radcliff attributed minton 's conservative position to the <unk> he developed for the courts when they overturned legislation passed while he was in the senate . the courts ' actions led him to strongly believe in the limited exercise of judicial power when evaluating the constitutionality of governmental conduct . much of the recently passed new deal legislation was being tried in the courts for constitutionality and enforcement , putting minton in the uncommon position of <unk> cases which depended on legislation he had helped <unk> his time on the seventh circuit , minton authored <integer> of the court 's opinions , including twelve dissenting opinions . some of his opinions won praise ; the editors of tax magazine commented <unk> on minton 's opinions on tax law , calling them `` direct <unk> logic '' . other court reporting papers made similar comments , <unk> the manner in which he turned complex issues to simple questions that could easily be <unk> the cases of <unk> v. <unk> and quaker <unk> co. v. general mills , the court held that it was possible for different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced <unk> products . in another case , the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive . after minton joined the united states supreme court , the decision was appealed to that body ; minton <unk> himself from the case , which the court decided to <unk> . in another decision , minton was in the majority that ruled under the sherman <unk> act that the new york great atlantic and pacific tea company was a monopoly , ordering the company to break up its <unk> business . minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the national labor relations board , usually to end worker <unk> the case of united states v. <unk> , the government denied the wife of a united states citizen entry into the country because of her possible ties to nazism . in a <unk> majority opinion which minton co-authored with judge major , he stated that the `` alien did not have any legal <unk> [ her ] status was a political decision to be made by officials in government . '' many liberals condemned the court at the time of the decision . the ruling was upheld by the supreme court in a <year> <unk> of minton 's favorite cases was that of <unk> <unk> , inc. v. federal trade commission . the candy company produced a <unk> <unk> <unk> in which almost all the <unk> were the same color . a few <unk> <unk> were included which , when <unk> , entitled the <unk> to a prize from the merchant who owned the machine . the <unk> had an <unk> put in place <unk> the company from producing the machines because they claimed it <unk> <unk> laws . minton wrote the majority opinion and sided with the majority to keep the <unk> in place , but <unk> <unk> the counsel for the defense and the gambling law , stating : counsel for the <unk> discussed at great length from a sociological point of view , of the <unk> problem of the gambling instinct in the human being . according to his analysis , gambling <unk> our entire economic system ; thus insurance contracts are a gamble , stock and <unk> exchange transactions are <unk> , and the farmer 's dependence on weather is a gamble . counsel 's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and <unk> . he even <unk> us that our great <unk> , mr. chief justice john marshall , in his day attended the horse races and <unk> with his <unk> . in fact , they ran a book . as indicating how times have changed and how even our <unk> nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy , we <unk> we do not even know a <unk> , clerical or otherwise , and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around chicago lie in our desk <unk> . minton often lamented that he was required to `` <unk> the law as it was written , but on no occasion [ c ] <unk> he make the law . '' === <unk> board and failing health === after roosevelt 's death and truman 's succession to the presidency , minton continued offering advice to the new administration on a range of topics , including patronage and political <unk> . truman appointed minton as head of the war department <unk> board , a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the <unk> . the panel met every two weeks which , along with his responsibilities on the circuit court , kept minton very busy and afforded him little rest , leading to a deterioration in his health . while <unk> with president truman on memorial day in <year> , truman asked minton to accept an appointment to the position of solicitor general of the united states . minton declined because of his health , but he told truman he would be interested in a seat on the supreme <unk> <month> <year> , minton suffered a heart attack while in washington ; he was hospitalized for three months at walter reed hospital . after returning to work , he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually <unk> anemia , and he sought to <unk> his workload . to further <unk> his health , on <month> <integer> , <year> , minton <unk> over a stone in his yard and broke his leg . the injury forced him to walk with a <unk> for the remainder of his life . == supreme court == === nomination and confirmation === at a <month> <integer> , <year> , news conference , truman announced minton 's nomination to the supreme court , succeeding the late justice wiley <unk> . minton had already privately accepted the nomination several days earlier after a telephone conversation with truman . truman <unk> minton 's extensive law education and his years of experience on the circuit courts as the reason for his nomination . news of minton 's appointment received mixed reviews nationally . the new york times said that truman had allowed personal and political friendship to influence his choice . the new republic said `` the president is again <unk> to his <unk> habit of choosing men for high post because they happen to be his friends .... '' the washington post raised questions about minton 's ability to be confirmed by the senate due to the power many of his foes held in the body . the indianapolis star offered a more sympathetic opinion , pointing out minton 's qualifications and the pride indiana could take in having a native on the supreme court . the article noted that he would be the most educated justice on the court , should he be <unk> senator william e. jenner led opponents of minton 's nomination , including some of minton 's old foes , in an attempt to bring him before the body for hearings . minton wrote a letter to the senate judicial committee answering several of their questions , but refused to submit himself to a hearing . he mentioned his broken leg and <unk> in his letter that it could be detrimental to his health to travel in his condition . he also stated that , as a sitting judge and former member of the senate , it would be improper for him submit to a hearing . although hearings had occurred <unk> in the past , it was not customary at that time to have a hearing on a nominee . during an absence of jenner 's , minton 's allies worked to have the hearing request dropped and the judicial committee sent the measure to the full senate in a vote of <integer> to <decimal> senator <unk> s. <unk> attempted to have the nomination returned to committee but the motion failed , <unk> . the long debate over minton 's appointment focused on his partisanship , support of the court packing plan during his time in the senate , and poor health . his opponents launched numerous <unk> tactics ; the senate session before the vote to confirm minton lasted until <unk> . his confirmation was approved <unk> on <month> <integer> , <year> and he received his commission on <month> <integer> , <year>. to date , minton remains the last member of congress , sitting or former , to be appointed to the united states supreme court , and he is the only native of indiana to be appointed to the court . === judicial restraint === minton 's central judicial philosophy was to <unk> and uphold the original intent of legislation . he continued to take a broad view of governmental powers , demonstrated in his dissenting vote in the case of <unk> sheet & <unk> co. v. <unk> , which ruled unconstitutional president truman 's wartime <unk> of several steel mills to avert a workers ' strike . of all the cases in which minton was involved , he disagreed most with the <unk> decision and `` went into a <unk> '' during the conference where the decision was made . he argued that there `` could be no vacant spot in power when the security of the nation is at stake . '' despite his strong protest , he could not influence the court to permit the president to seize the plants without congressional approval . minton joined with chief justice fred m. vinson and justice stanley <unk> reed in the dissenting opinion that the president had the authority through the war powers <unk> of the constitution . minton <unk> racial segregation and provided a solid vote to strike down the school segregation practices at issue in <year> 's landmark case of brown v. board of education ; it was among the few decisions in which he sided against the government . according to william radcliff , the majority opinion authored by minton in the <year> case <unk> v. jackson was his most <unk> written opinion . he <unk> the complex question of the case as : `` can a <unk> restrictive <unk> be <unk> at law by a suit for <unk> against a <unk> who allegedly broke the <unk> ? '' the court decided the answer in the <unk> the area of civil liberties , minton <unk> to the doctrine of `` fundamental <unk> '' , a test established by the supreme court in <year>. in one decision , minton stated that the right of free speech was not an absolute right , and could be regulated so as not to <unk> the rights of others . in united states v. <unk> , minton wrote the court 's opinion <unk> a lower court ruling which allowed police to search <unk> without a warrant , provided there was <unk> cause to justify the <unk> voted to uphold <unk> legislation during the period of the `` red <unk> '' , <unk> with the majority in <year> 's dennis v. united states , which upheld the conviction of the leader of the us communist party . during the same period , the court was split over the <unk> of governmental loyalty tests . many agencies had programs in place to ensure that members of the government were not communists . minton 's vote proved to be the deciding factor in cases regarding loyalty tests . in the case of bailey v. <unk> , minton 's vote upheld the <unk> of the loyalty tests , while in the decision he authored in the case of joint anti-fascist refugee committee v. <unk> , he voted to uphold the plaintiff 's position that he had been <unk> illegally because of his support of fascist ideology . minton 's position gradually shifted to allowing the loyalty tests to take place , and in adler v. board of ed . of city of new york he wrote the majority opinion allowing the tests and <unk> new york 's <unk> law . this proved to be the most important vote as it allowed the tests to be given with only minimal suspicion of a person 's <unk> to the <unk> of minton 's previous congressional partisanship , many liberals believed he would support their positions when on the court . throughout his tenure , minton regularly disappointed them , leading many to rail against him . a lawyer writing for the new jersey law journal labeled minton a `` spokesman against freedom '' , calling him `` a man of <unk> judicial <unk> , whose votes against civil liberties exceeded those of any other man on the court , and who wrote comparatively few opinions of other kinds . '' linda gugin pointed out that minton was a disappointment to liberals because he consistently chose order over freedom . gugin also concludes that minton had the strongest commitment to judicial restraint and ideological <unk> of any justice , past or present . === politics === although minton was on the supreme court , he remained <unk> involved in democratic internal politics . he wrote truman several letters criticizing justices robert h. jackson and hugo black , referring to black as a <unk> . he also offered advice on dealing with republican opposition in the senate . in a <year> letter , after truman left office , he urged truman to help focus public attention on the economy and away from communism , a threat he claimed the republicans were <unk> to avoid confronting their own <unk> truman 's withdrawal from the <year> presidential campaign , minton made remarks indicating he had advised truman to stay out of the <unk> new hampshire primary election to begin with . in <month> <year> , a reporter asked minton about his preferred candidate in the upcoming presidential election . minton answered , `` i have great confidence in adlai stevenson . '' he also remarked that dwight d. eisenhower was politically handicapped . minton was <unk> in the media for his <unk> , which he attempted to <unk> a few days later after being advised to do so by other members of the court . === regular <unk> === truman 's other <unk> to the court provided consistent conservative votes , and during minton 's first years on the court it was returned to the <unk> of the william howard taft era . while on the court , minton transformed from a new deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of justice felix <unk> . empirical coding of votes shows that minton was the most conservative justice on the court during his first year , and remained in the conservative half of the court for the duration of his <unk> did not <unk> the limited influence of his judicial role in the later years of his term , when he was more frequently in the minority in voting on cases . after the deaths of chief justice fred m. vinson and justice robert jackson , minton found himself with little support for many of his opinions , which led him to begin considering <unk> shifting position of the court led to personal <unk> between members of its two wings . despite his disappointment over the court 's positions on some issues , minton remained popular among his colleagues on the court as he did n't take sides in their personal disagreements ; he proved a <unk> presence during a period marked by bitter personal feuds between strong <unk> such as william o. douglas and felix <unk> informed eisenhower of his intention to retire in a letter on <month> <integer> , <year> , in which he <unk> stated his retirement was authorized by law . eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement . although he did not tell the president , minton informed the members of the court that his duties were too <unk> on his health . his anemia had steadily worsened , <unk> him physically and mentally . minton served as a justice until <month> <integer> , <year> , retiring after <integer> years and <integer> days of service . he was succeeded by william j. <unk> jr . == later life == === retirement === announcing his departure , minton remarked , `` there will be more interest in who will succeed me than in my passing . i 'm an <unk> . '' despite the health difficulties , minton regretted his decision almost <unk> returned to his new albany home , where he took a much <unk> workload . he gave occasional lectures at indiana university and continued to give public speeches from time to time . for several years after retiring from the supreme court , minton occasionally accepted assignments to serve temporarily on one of the lower federal courts . he received an honorary doctorate degree from the university of louisville . he took many trips around the united states , and two trips to europe . in england , he received an honorary doctorate from oxford university in <unk> his failing health , minton remained active in the democratic party . he was most concerned with president eisenhower , who he believed was <unk> . he remained in regular correspondence with truman , and the two met on several occasions at democratic party functions . === death and legacy === in late <month> <year> , minton was admitted to floyd memorial hospital in new albany , where it was found he was suffering internal <unk> . he died in his sleep early in the morning of <month> <decimal> minton 's wife was roman catholic ; his funeral was held at the <unk> holy trinity catholic church and was attended by many <unk> , including several sitting members of the supreme court , the governors of indiana and kentucky , and several members of congress . he was buried in the holy trinity cemetery , on green valley road in new albany , next to leo <unk> . minton himself was nominally catholic and had shunned christianity for most of his life ; he only began to occasionally attend mass following his retirement . he left most of his personal papers and judicial records to the truman presidential <unk> is the <unk> of the sherman minton bridge , which carries <unk> <integer> across the ohio river , connecting western louisville , kentucky with new albany , indiana . minton attended the dedication of the bridge at a <year> ceremony . he is also the namesake of the annual sherman minton <unk> court competition , held at the indiana university <unk> school of law . he is also honored ( with indiana senator <unk> e. <unk> ) <unk> the `` <unk> '' style designed by <unk> , <unk> and partners and with architectural art by milton <unk> the centrally located <unk> federal building on indiana world war memorial <unk> in indianapolis . a bronze bust of minton was created and put on display in the indiana <unk> some writers like linda gugin and legal historian william radcliff have given high praise to minton 's logic in his written opinions , they point out that his positions had little long-term impact . other legal historians , like bernard schwartz , have a more negative opinion of minton 's judicial career . schwartz wrote that minton `` was below <unk> as a justice . his opinions , relatively few for his tenure , are less than third rate , characterized by their <unk> approach to complicated issues . '' schwartz went on to say , `` he ranks near the bottom of any list of justices . '' most of the <unk> minton helped establish were overturned by the warren court in the years immediately following his retirement . in total he wrote <unk> majority opinions along with several of the dissenting opinions . gugin authored a work in rebuttal to schwartz 's harsh critique , saying that minton 's <unk> were `` <unk> based on the principles of <unk> , precedent , and strict interpretation '' ; she attributed his poor ranking to the bias of <unk> in favor of judicial <unk> 's time on the court marked the end of a transitory period in the <unk> . since minton , justices have tended to serve increasingly longer terms on the court , which has had strong political science implications on the supreme court . the growing concept of judicial <unk> became the <unk> in american politics after <unk> was the last member of congress to be appointed to the court . linda gugin and professor james st. <unk> have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced <unk> among their <unk> played an important role behind the scenes of the court as a <unk> between its two opposing factions . these attempts to keep the peace led justice <unk> to remark that while minton would never be remembered as a great justice , he would be remembered as a great colleague by his fellow justices . == electoral history == == see also ==

metal wires suspended from a <unk> remaining work was done at harvard 's physical laboratories . using sound capture technology that had been developed by physicist g. w. pierce , galambos and pierce were able to determine that bats generate and hear sounds an <unk> higher than can be heard by humans and other animals . experiments they conducted used methods developed by <unk> davis to monitor the brains of bats and their hearing responses as they <unk> their way past wires suspended from a laboratory <unk> . they showed how bats used echolocation to accurately avoid obstacles , which they were unable to do if their <unk> or <unk> were kept <unk> . griffin coined the term `` echolocation '' in <year> to describe the phenomenon , which many physiologists of the day could not believe was possible . during world war ii , griffin worked for national defense research committee where he supported the approval of the bat <unk> a time when animal thinking was a topic deemed unfit for

'' fei believes that political beliefs and ideology are the strongest factors in shaping economic policy-making , and thus is an ongoing process . in following with the concept of evolutionary economics , fei believes that economic policy must change to suit new and <unk> situations . therefore , policy should not be static when created and instead evolve and be improved on to adapt to new situations . li himself claims that the liberalization of the <unk> economy was a gradual process rather than an <unk> one following the international <unk> of free market ideology in the <year>s and <year>s . === pragmatic economics === li argues that there are two types of issues central to analyzing policy evolution . first is the economic impact of a policy , second is causation , or why a certain policy appears and is implemented at a certain time . li believes pragmatism should <unk> ideology in terms of policy-making : [ policy innovation should be based on ] the anticipation of impending problems and conflicts , rather than be purely <unk> motivated . . . the very notion of an evolution of policy suggests that the timing ( or timely appearance ) of a particular policy is important , and a good policy innovation is one that does not arrive <unk> . ideological considerations often get in the way of appropriate timing as , for example , with so-called welfare state legislation that the economy simply can not support . what can almost be called a rejection of ideology lies at the heart of a healthy pragmatism that has guided policymakers in taiwan and has supported a social consensus for growth and economic <unk> argues against ideology-based policy making because it often <unk> with the timing of certain policies , and all too often change too quickly . he believes such policy is “ motivated by goals considered larger than people ’ s actual well-being , ” which is a <unk> review of ideology-based policy . rather than ideology , li believes the economic environment in which policies are made is more important and that policy should not be restricted by the <unk> <unk> of ideology-based economics . === policy revision === li 's trial and error policy making was made possible by taiwan 's flexible government policy . li says that it made it possible to abandon or modify ineffective programs and easily create and implement new ones in reaction to new <unk> 's policies were often influenced by his experiences as part of the <unk> in mainland china . hyperinflation was one of the major reasons that <unk> <unk> lost mainland china to the communist party , and thus li <unk> all inflationary finance during his management of taiwan 's economy . his aversion to relying on inflation is apparent in his claim : taiwan ’ s experience shows that fiscal reforms ( tax legislation ) and monetary reforms ( moving toward central bank <unk> ) are major <unk> <unk> steps taken by a responsible government . . . what <unk> both reforms is a rejection of the <unk> of relying on the printing press to create purchasing power for the government to use in an effort to solve socioeconomic <unk> indicates that this was the main difference between taiwan 's policy and those in latin american countries , and that this method of managing the economy led to an overall more responsible government and <unk> taxation system . li claims that during the <unk> , the liberalization of taiwan 's economy was an <unk> effect of their new policy , and it was n't until <year> that such `` <unk> growth '' was seen as beneficial and the <unk> of international competition in the domestic market was encouraged . furthermore , li says that taiwan 's government was guided at the start with the principle that private property and a market environment which favored private businesses were to be encouraged . li writes : other <unk> measures taken by the government included improving the investment climate , <unk> administrative procedures . . . providing necessary financing through banking institutions , and promoting investment and exports through tax relief and other <unk> was the framework for li 's principle of people 's <unk> where the importance of protecting private property for the improvement of socioeconomic activities and establishing a free economy was only <unk> by the need to expand state capital . yu claims that this view falls under what robert wade calls the `` guided market economy . '' li argues that the main problem with other less developed countries ( ldcs ) was that : the alleged failure of the market in some other ldcs <month> , in fact , be due precisely to the opposite reason : the failure of political intervention in the market . although the market structure was far from perfect at the beginning of transition growth in the <year>s , the overall trend has been for a strengthening of the market <unk> <unk> of the market . taiwan experience shows that reduced intervention can <unk> argues that without the same willingness in developing countries to support a free market , taiwan 's economic <unk> and history are <unk> to them . === government 's role === li explains that taiwan 's economic development was initially set back by the `` <unk> of natural resources , <unk> of capital and foreign exchange , technological backwardness , and lack of entrepreneurial skills , '' however , through the government 's direct involvement and encouragement , the infrastructure and incentives needed for private enterprises to <unk> , including <unk> of risk , was created : among the major initiatives have been : the formulation of investment program and the provision of <unk> loans ; the establishment of industrial zones , <unk> zones , and the <unk> industrial park ; ten major development projects , the twelve new development projects and the fourteen key projects in the <year>s and <year>s . the government also adopted various supplementary fiscal , financial , <unk> , and <unk> measures to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> 's government made certain to not compete with private enterprises unless absolutely necessary , and the most <unk> investment projects were left for private businesses to take . many times the government would first conduct feasibility studies before offering low interest loans to private entrepreneurs . other times the government acted as sole owner of a business before <unk> it over to private <unk> , li was a strong believer that it was important for the government to step back once the private sector became more established . fiscal policy would then become more of a `` <unk> and <unk> mechanism to <unk> fluctuations in private economic behaviour . the evolution of fiscal policy in taiwan has followed the same progression . . . with government intervention diminishing as the economy moved steadily in the direction of liberalization . `` this leads to li 's argument that there are two main major roles played by the government in economic development : enforcement of competition : to promote competition in small developing countries , it is best to open up the economy and expose domestic enterprises to international competition . li believes <unk> laws are <unk> in open economies . in new industries , government protection should only be given in the initial period . identify the areas of production characterized by <unk> ( `` activities where the producers of the goods or services can not easily charge those who benefit '' -- this is somewhat different from the common view of <unk> ) : goods with external effect are not fixed and will mature with the economy . thus , government operated sectors can become more <unk> as the economy <unk> , although it is reasonably difficult to decide what the government should provide based on external economies , and therefore should remain an ongoing task . === <unk> === on the topic of taiwan 's economic success being <unk> to other developing countries , li believes that : ... while our policy experiences can not be transferred to ldcs as a whole package , individual measures ( such as <unk> and investment incentives ) that i introduced have , from time to time , been adopted successfully by <unk> countries [ ... ] if an experience can be <unk> at all , the key question concerns the circumstances under which the policy is instituted . if the circumstances are too different , it is not likely that the policy will lead to the same result . the question of a policy ’ s result is an economic issue , but the way policy is formulated is a political issue . good economics can be rejected by bad politics . hence , whether or not taiwan ’ s policy experience can be transferred to other developing economies depends very much on whether their cultures can allow pragmatism to overcome ideology as well as on how strongly they are dedicated to political and economic <unk> taiwan experienced relative economic success over the course of its history along with the other four asian <unk> which employed similar economic policies as taiwan , the lack of the same `` <unk> '' development in latin american countries that employed the same principles brings into question whether li 's policies can be fully transferred and result in <unk> success . li also did not consider external factors that helped taiwan 's initial economic growth , such as the economic and military aid provided by the us government from <year>–1965 , which helped to <unk> inflation . === economic achievement === taiwan experienced gdp growth of <decimal> % a year from <year> to <year> with no deterioration in income distribution , an improvement in literacy , a longer life <unk> than almost all other developing countries , increases in manufacturing earnings of <integer> % a year from <year> to <year> , and unemployment at less than <integer> % since <year>. as of <year> , income per person was three to ten times higher than china . in <year> taiwan 's per capita income was below the mediterranean countries , and well below any latin american country and malaysia , whereas by <year> taiwan 's per capita income had reached us $ <year> , much higher than malaysia , brazil , and mexico , and on par with portugal , argentina , and

, including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and wood products , radio , television , <unk> <unk> , electronic <unk> , <unk> machines , machine tools , <unk> , and computers . this was a stark change from <year> 's exports , which were <integer> % agricultural , consisting of mainly sugar and <unk> little writes , `` government expenditure fell from <decimal> % of gnp in <year> to <integer> % in <year> ,

' '' george did not talk about the <unk> , yet had <unk> visible features in his skull that came from the <unk> . the <unk> , his father 's family represented a different <unk> of public and service , the tradition of professions . for generations the family focused on two professions , medical practice and law . the homans ' came from a lineage of distinguished doctors that began when the first john homans came to the country from <unk> , kent , england in the <days> century . his son , dr. john homans , harvard university graduate , was the first to become a doctor and begin the reputation of the john <unk> ( homans <unk> ) . `` george 's father was a lawyer , but george was the first member of the family to <unk> the law '' . == personal life == homans attended st. paul 's school in concord , new hampshire , from <year> to <year>.from his autobiography ( homans <year> ) , it is learned that homans entered harvard college in <year> with a concentration in english and american literature . during his undergraduate years pursued poetry and had developed a grand ambition to become a writer and poet . george published his original works in the harvard advocate , in which he was elected into the editorial board . after graduating in <year> , homans wanted to pursue a career as a <unk> with a `` job beginning in the fall with william allen white of the <unk> , kansas , gazette , '' but because of the depression the newspaper could no longer offer him the job , leaving homans unemployed ( homans <unk> ) . `` in <year> , he married nancy <unk> cooper who remained his lifelong compatible partner '' <unk> served in the naval reserve ( <year> ) he always had a love for the sea , as an undergraduate he assisted on helping samuel eliot morrison in writing massachusetts on the sea , so much so that morrison named homans co-author . george served four years and a half on active duty , serving five years in the navy in total , more than <unk> were spent in command of several small ships engaged in anti submarine warfare and the <unk> of <unk> operations ( homans <unk> ) . although he served for the duration of the war , in his autobiography coming to my senses : the education of sociologist ( <year> ) , he later expressed his `` <unk> with the constraints of the naval hierarchy and his disdain for staff desk officers , especially those in bureaucratic branches such as the supply corps '' . == education and becoming a sociologist == while homans was at harvard college , where he spent most of his time along the banks of charles , in harvard george met the person that directly influenced his life . bernard ( `` <unk> '' ) de voto , `` a <unk> man , <unk> in his literary feuds whose name has been largely forgotten '' was a part-time member of the harvard faculty and tutored homans in english . `` george ... was attracted to de voto 's stories about the <unk> and the <unk> , but more , to the <unk> of the lives of people and the american character as expressed in <unk> writing . in many ways , too , `` george adopted the <unk> of de voto , the <unk> <unk> <unk> ( but not for either the <unk> <unk> ) and the scorn of <unk> rhetoric '' . <unk> <unk> and <unk> , yet <unk> battling his own <unk> within his closed heart . he reserved all his pain and suffering for his poetry , which is seen in his book of poetry the <unk> hazel ( <year> ) . homans became interested in sociology by living in an environment where people are highly conscious of social relations . homans describes his entrance to sociology as `` a matter of chance ; or rather , i got into sociology because i had nothing better to do '' ( homans <unk> ) . lawrence joseph henderson , a biochemist and sociologist who believed that all sciences should be based on a unified set of theoretical and methodological principles , was an important <unk> on homans ' perspective . homans , with no job and nothing to do , attended henderson 's seminar at harvard one day and was immediately taken by his lecture . homans was also influenced by professor <unk> <month>o , where he was assigned to readings by prominent social <unk> . from these readings , homans developed his belief that instead of similarities in cultures , `` members of the human species working in similar circumstances had independently created the similar institutions . `` as a result , homans joined a discussion group at harvard called the pareto circle , which was led by henderson and inspired by the work of <unk> pareto . henderson often discussed <unk> pareto in his lectures . pareto was a sociologist concerned with economic distribution . pareto 's theories and henderson 's lectures influenced homans ' first book , an introduction to pareto , co-authored with fellow circle member charles p. curtis . from <year> to <year> homans was selected to become a part of the society of fellows a newly formed institution founded by a. lawrence lowell at harvard , undertaking a variety of studies in various areas , including sociology , psychology , and history . his comrades in the institution included , van <unk> , andrew <unk> and b.f. skinner most of whom went on to become harvard professors . in the institution the companions educated each other , george learned the most form his companion b.f. skinner . skinner taught homans about the method of meticulous observation and the idea of reinforcement . `` one can say that , in <unk> , george homans 's sociology was a <unk> of <unk> reinforcement with utility theory . '' for his junior fellowship project homans undertook an anthropological study of rural england , later published as english villagers of the thirteenth century ( <year> ) which he wrote in lieu of a ph.d. that he never received . ( see homans <year> : <integer> ) . homans was taken into the graduate program at harvard ; <unk> <unk> , founder of harvard 's sociology department in <year> , was credited with bringing homans and robert merton into the program . from this knowledge gained , `` the key idea that homans took away from these studies was the <unk> of interaction and the way sentiments developed between individuals as a consequence on interaction . '' == teaching == in <year> homans became a harvard faculty member , a lifelong <unk> in which he taught both sociology and medieval history `` as well as studied poetry and small groups . '' this teaching brought him in contact with new works in industrial sociology and exposed him to works of functional <unk> . he was an instructor of sociology until <year> when he left to serve in the u.s. navy to support the war effort . after four years away , he came back to boston and continued his teaching as an associate professor from <year> to <year> , and a full professor of sociology after <year>. he was a ford foundation fellow at harvard 's graduate school of business administration . he was also a visiting professor at the university of manchester in <year> , at cambridge university from <year> to <year> , and at the university of kent in <year>. by <unk> of his theoretical writings ( discussed below ) , he was elected <days> president of the american sociological association in <year>. he retired from teaching in <year> . == theoretical agenda and general argument == as a theorist , homans ' overall intellectual ambition was to create a more unified social science on a firm theoretical basis . his approach to theory developed in two phases , usually interpreted by commentators as <unk> and deductive . although this is a bit of an <unk> , it provides a framework for <unk> his theoretical contributions . in its mature ( <year> ) form , homans ' theory rests upon two <unk> claims : ( <integer> ) the basic principles of social science must be true of individuals as members of the human species , not as members of particular groups or cultures ; and ( <integer> ) any other generalizations or facts about human social life will be <unk> from these principles ( and suitable initial conditions ) . he argued that large-scale structures can be understood if we understand elementary social <unk> way to grasp his argument is to interpret it as striving to explain spontaneous social order , a point developed in detail by <unk> ( <year> ) . homans ' approach is an example of methodological individualism in social science , also favored by some more recent influential social theorists , particularly those who have adopted some form of rational choice theory ( e.g. , james s. <unk> ) that <unk> greater deductive fertility in <unk> often with a cost in terms of some loss of realism . == the human group == homans was impressed by henderson 's notion of a conceptual scheme . a conceptual scheme consists of a classification of variables ( or concepts ) that need to be taken into account when studying a set of phenomena . it also consists of a sketch of the given conditions within which the phenomena are to be analyzed . it also must contain a statement that the variables are related to one <unk> following pareto , that relationship is usually seen as one of mutual <unk> was very interested in henderson 's conceptual scheme as a way of <unk> phenomena and applied it to his own study of small groups . henderson 's teachings were included in homans ' work the human group ( <year> ) . this book 's ultimate goal was to move from a study of the social system as it is <unk> in single groups toward a study of the system as it is <unk> in many groups , including groups changing in time . the work has a theme of , `` the way group norms develop and the ways a group , <unk> or <unk> , seeks to maintain the <unk> of the group when members <unk> from group norms . '' homans <unk> that , `` the general propositions would have to meet only one condition : in accordance with my original insight , they should apply to individual human beings as members of a species . `` homans said , `` if we wanted to establish the reality of a social system as a complex of mutually dependent elements , why not begin by studying a system small enough so that we could , so to speak , see all the way around it , small enough so that all the relevant observations could be made in detail and at first hand ? '' he fulfilled this study throughout the human group . this book allowed him to make certain generalizations , including the idea that the more frequently people interact with one another , when no one <unk> <unk> interactions more than others , the greater is their <unk> for one another and their feeling of ease in one another 's presence . although this was n't homans ' greatest piece of work , it allowed him to become more familiar with this type of methodology and led him to explain elementary social behavior . in this work , homans also proposes that social reality should be described at three levels : social events , customs , and analytical hypotheses that describe the processes by which customs <unk> and are maintained or changed . hypotheses are formulated in terms of relationships among variables such as frequency of interaction , <unk> of activities , intensity of sentiment , and <unk> to norms . using notable sociological and anthropological field studies as the <unk> for such general ideas , the book makes a persuasive case for treating groups as social systems that can be analyzed in terms of a verbal analogue of the mathematical method of studying equilibrium and stability of systems . in his theoretical analyses of these groups , he begins to use ideas that later <unk> large in his work , e.g. , reinforcement and exchange . along the way , he <unk> important general phenomena such as social control , authority , <unk> , and <unk> . == the exchange theory == the exchange theory is the `` perspective that individuals seek to maximize their own private <unk> . it <unk> that these rewards can only be found in social interactions and thus people seek rewards in their interactions with each other '' . homans ' exchange theory propositions are partially based on b.f. skinner 's <unk> . homans took b.f. skinner 's propositions about pigeon behavior and applied it to human <unk> heart of homans ' exchange theory lies in propositions based on economic and psychological principles . according to homans , they are psychological for two reasons : first , because they are usually tested on people who call themselves psychologists and second , because of the level at which they deal with the individual in society . he believed that a sociology built on his principles would be able to explain all social behavior . homans said , `` an <unk> advantage of an exchange theory is that it might bring sociology closer to economics '' ( homans <unk> ) . overall , homans ' exchange theory , `` can be condensed to a view of the actor as a rational profit <unk> . `` he regretted that his theory was labeled `` exchange theory '' because he saw this theory of social behavior as a behavioral psychology applied to specific situations . homans looked to émile durkheim 's work for guidance as well , but often disagreed in the end with particular components of durkheim 's theories . for example , durkheim believed that although individuals are clearly the component parts of society , society is more than the individuals who constitute it . he believed that society could be studied without reducing it to individuals and their <unk> . homans , through his exchange theory , believed that individual beings and behavior are relevant to understanding society . == albert chavannes and the exchange theory == although george homans contributed greatly to the exchange theory and his work on it is greatly admired , he was not the first person to study this theory . `` from <year> to <year> albert chavannes published in the sociologist a series of papers titled <unk> in sociology ' which treated 'the law of exchange ' and three other social laws . '' chavannes ' work on the theory was similar to what homans did . however , he focused more on empirical sociology , and he did not contribute to it in the same way as homans ( <unk> <year> : <integer> ) . although homans <month> have not have been the first to work on this theory , his contributions make the exchange theory what it is today . == social behavior == homans 's next major work was social behavior : its elementary forms . he wrote this book in <year> and revised it in <year>. this was based on the principles of behavioral psychology , and helped explain the `` <unk> , '' or elementary , forms of social behavior in small groups . this explanation of social behavior first appeared in an article homans published titled `` social behavior as exchange '' in <year>. he believed his exchange theory was derived from both behavioral psychology and elementary <unk> had come to the view that theory should be expressed as a deductive system , in this respect falling under the influence of the logical <unk> philosophers of that period . <unk> , he argued that a satisfactory explanation in the social sciences is based upon `` propositions '' <unk> individual behavior that are drawn from the behavioral psychology of the time . homans did n't believe that new propositions are needed to explain social behavior . the laws of individual behavior developed by skinner in his study of pigeons explain social behavior as long as we take into account the complications of mutual reinforcement . `` social behavior is an exchange of goods , material goods , but also <unk> ones , such as the symbols of approval or prestige . persons that give much to others try to get much from them , and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them . '' ( homans <unk> ) . social behavior as exchange means that a <unk> of individuals , each postulated to behave according to the stated behavioral principles , form a system of interaction . social approval is the basic reward that people can give to one another . in much greater detail , he developed this approach in his book social behavior : its elementary forms ( <year> , revised <year> ) . homans gives an example of this type of social behavior below : `` suppose that two men are doing <unk> jobs in an office . according to the office rules , each should do his job by himself , or , if he needs help , he should <unk> the supervisor . one of the men , whom we shall call person , is not skillful at the work and would get it done better and faster if he got help from time to time . in spite of the rules he is reluctant to go to the supervisor , for to <unk> his <unk> might <unk> his chances for promotion . instead he seeks out the other man , whom we shall call other for short , and asks him for help . other is more experienced at the work than is person ; he can do his work well and quickly and be left with time to spare , and he has reason to suppose that the supervisor will not go out of his way to look for a breach of rules . other gives person help and in return person gives other thanks and expressions of approval . the two men have exchanged help and approval . '' ( homans , <unk> ) focusing on this situation , and <unk> his ideas on skinner 's findings , homans developed several propositions . == the success proposition == `` for all actions taken by persons , the more often a particular action of a person is rewarded , the more likely the person is to perform that action . '' ( homans , <unk> ) in terms of his `` <unk> '' example , this proposition means that a person is more likely to ask others for advice if past advice has been useful . also , the more often a person received useful advice in the past , the more often they will request more advice and be willing to give advice . the success proposition involves three stages : ( <integer> ) a person 's action , ( <integer> ) a rewarded result , and ( <integer> ) a <unk> of the original action . == the stimulus proposition == `` if in the past the occurrence of a particular stimulus , or set of stimuli , has been the occasion on which a person 's action has been rewarded , then the more similar the present stimuli are to the past ones , the more likely the person is to perform the action , or some similar action . '' ( homans , <unk> ) one <month> look at homans ' example : if in the past , the person and other found the giving and getting of advice <unk> , they are likely to engage in similar actions and in similar situations in the future . homans ' example : `` a <unk> who has cast his line into a dark pool and has caught a fish becomes more <unk> to fish in dark <unk> again '' ( <unk> ) . homans was interested in the process of <unk> , or the tendency to extend behavior to similar circumstances ; but he was also concerned with the process of discrimination . for example , person and other <month> only give useful advice in the same room as in the past because they think that particular situation brought the most success . == the value proposition == `` the more valuable to a person is the result of his action , the more likely he is to perform the action . '' ( homans , <unk> ) if the rewards each offers to the other are considered valuable , the actors are more likely to perform the desired behaviors than they are if the rewards are not valuable . homans introduced the concepts of rewards and <unk> . rewards are actions with positive values and <unk> are actions with negative values . rewards can either be materialistic ( money ) or <unk> ( helping others ) he found punishment to be an inefficient means of getting people to change their behavior , because people <month> <unk> in undesirable ways to punishment . == the <unk> proposition == `` the more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward , the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes for him . '' ( homans , <unk> ) in the office , person and other <month> reward each other so often for giving and getting advice that the rewards cease to be valuable to them . time is <unk> are less likely to become <unk> if particular rewards are <unk> over a long period of time . homans then defined cost and profit . cost of any behavior is defined as the rewards lost in <unk> alternative lines of action . profit in social exchange is seen as the greater number of rewards gained over costs incurred . == the <unk> propositions == `` proposition a : when a person 's action does not receive the rewards as expected , or receives punishment he did not expect , he will be angry . he becomes more likely to perform aggressive <unk> [ sic ] , and the results of such behavior become more valuable to him . '' ( homans , <unk> ) if person does not get the advice they expected and other does not receive the praise they anticipated , both are likely to be angry . `` proposition b : when a person 's action receives the reward they expected , especially a greater reward than they expected , or does not receive punishment he expected , he will be pleased . he becomes more likely to perform <unk> behavior , and the results of such behavior become more valuable to him . '' ( homans , <unk> ) when person gets the advice they expect , and other gets the praise they expect , both are more likely to get or give advice . proposition a on <unk> refers to negative emotions , whereas proposition b deals with positive emotions . == the rationality proposition == `` in choosing between alternative actions , a person will choose that one for which , as perceived by him at the time , the value , v , of the result , multiplied by the probability , p , of getting the result , is the greater . '' ( homans , <unk> ) when earlier propositions rely on <unk> , the rationality proposition <unk> the influence of rational choice theory on homans ' approach . in economic terms , actors who act in accord with the rationality proposition are maximizing their utilities . people examine and make calculations about alternative actions open to them . they compare the amount of rewards associated with each course of action and calculate the likelihood that they will receive the <unk> other words , there is a relationship between the value of the reward and the likelihood of the <unk> . the rationality proposition tells us that people will perform an action depending on their perception of the probability of success . durkheim agreed with homans ' understanding of rationality . he believed that <unk> is an aspect of individualism . durkheim said that all development of individualism has the effect of opening moral consciousness to new ideas and rendering it more demanding . homans worked off of durkheim 's thoughts throughout the development of certain propositions . == legacy == he died of a heart <unk> on <month> <integer> , <year> , in cambridge , massachusetts ; at his death , he left behind his wife , nancy , and three children as well as four grandchildren . george c. homans left to the sociological world many works on social theory , and is best known for his exchange theory and his works on social behavior . the impact he had on his students and colleagues and people he came in contact with is described by charles tilly in `` george caspar homans and the rest of us '' : `` his students inherited <unk> of theory for its own sake and theories about theories . even when they disagreed , his students and readers came away stimulated and <unk> . george was a <unk> , a <unk> '' ( tilly , <unk> ) . also , homans ' election as president of the american sociological association in <year> allowed him to have a greater impact on sociology . as tilly also noted : `` his differences made a difference to us , his colleagues , his friends , and successors . george was not , it is true , above <unk> in his own talents , and thereby <unk> or <unk> those about him '' ( tilly , <unk> ) . == quotes by homans == `` sociology is the profession of studying and teaching about what happens when at least two persons are in a position to influence one another '' ( homans , <unk> ) `` given the chance , i have always deserted anything that might have contemporary practical importance or that might lead to reforms . i have deserted the twentieth century for the thirteenth , social pathology for primitive kinship , industrial sociology for the study of small groups . it <month> have been mere <unk> ... my nerves <month> have been too weak for the modern world . what never failed to interest me was not sociology as an agent of change or as a means of understanding my immediate environment but sociology as a <unk> science . what were the best possibilities for establishing generalizations ? what were the main intellectual issues ? by what handle shall we lay hold on it ? `` `` as far as what good my work does people , i ’ m sorry to say that it does much more by way of <unk> people to what <month> go wrong than it does in telling them what they can do about it . `` `` when you ’ re talking about reforming an industrial system , you have to talk about something that can be operated across the board . with much attention , very skilled people , small groups , reform always can be successful in some sense . but then people <unk> from this to something that ’ s going to operate across the board and reform the whole industrial system . they forget the homans principle that no society , no governmental system , or no industrial system can work successfully if it depends on extraordinary abilities on the part of the people who run it . it has to be <unk> by ordinary damn <unk> like me . `` `` in human terms , it is hopeless . all of us believe in <unk> at <unk> is , <unk> believe in it . at other times , we believe we ’ re free . our behavior is completely , but it <unk> ’ t make damn bit of difference to me because i can ’ t predict it . i can ’ t show how the behavior of different men , behavior of <unk> the same general propositions , <unk> over time to produce particular results . the trouble is that the past behavior that <unk> if you <unk> behavior is linked together in complex chains , creating the illusion of freedom .

'' bettelheim took a position against this plan , to which fidel castro had also <unk> : both che guevara and castro preferred the <unk> of sugar as the basis of cuban economy , rather than a strict analogy to the economy of the soviet union . in cuba , bettelheim recommended a diversified economy , based on agriculture , prudent industrialization , broad central planning , mixed forms of property ownership with market <unk> pragmatic strategy similar to the `` new economic policy '' begun in russia by vladimir lenin in <year>. opposing guevara , bettelheim argued ( in line with the last writings of stalin ) that the `` law of value '' was the <unk> of objective social conditions which could not be overcome by <unk> decisions , but only by a process of long-term social transformation . this debate demonstrated the profound differences which , from then on , separated bettelheim from marxist `` orthodoxy '' , which considered socialism as the result of `` the development of maximum centralization of all forces of industrial production '' . for bettelheim , socialism is rather an alternative voice in development ; a process of transformation of social <unk> . inspired by the chinese cultural revolution and the thought of mao zedong , and in cooperation with the marxist philosopher louis <unk> , bettelheim was opposed to `` <unk> '' and to the `` primacy of the means of production '' of traditional marxism : against the idea that socialist transformation of social bonds was a necessary effect of the development of the forces of production ( liberating those bonds from them , according to marxist orthodoxy , since private property <unk> them in `` bourgeois '' society ) , he affirmed the necessity for actively and politically transforming social connections . in his book economic calculations and forms of ownership ( calcul économique et formes de <unk> ) , bettelheim <unk> the problems of transition to socialism , while criticizing the <unk> that nationalization and state ownership of the means of production was already `` socialist '' <unk> is not the legal form of property , but true <unk> of the web of production , which <unk> such a transition ; the crucial problem in socialist planning is the replacement of the form of `` value '' with the development of a method of measurement which takes into account the social utility of production . === chinese experience and analysis of the soviet union === in china , bettelheim had the impression that he was in the process of witnessing just such a process of transformation . more specifically , he noted that the cultural <unk> revolution of the political , ideological and cultural <unk> the industrial organization accompanying it by a general participation by the workers in all decisions , and overcoming the division of `` manual '' and `` intellectual '' labor . during these years , china was the <unk> for the neo-marxist `` radical school of economics '' , represented by bettelheim , paul <unk> , andre gunder frank , <unk> <unk> and others who , by fighting against theories of `` modernization , '' affirmed that at the <unk> of the worldwide capitalist system , in `` under-developed '' countries , `` development '' is only possible under conditions where these countries <unk> themselves free from their unequal and <unk> connections with the world market , dominated by imperialist countries , in order to choose a different and autonomous path : a development of production neither for profit , nor for an accumulation of abstract wealth , but for the needs of the people . under the banner of such a `` maoist '' approach , bettelheim began his voluminous work on the history of the soviet union : les luttes de classes en urss ( <year>–1982 ) ( class struggle in the ussr ( <year>–1982 ) ) , where he <unk> the reasons for the <unk> of soviet socialism , which , according to bettelheim , is nothing more than a `` state capitalism . '' bettelheim showed that after the <month> revolution , the bolsheviks had not succeeded in any long-term stabilization of the alliance between workers and poor peasants which had earlier been conceived by lenin . during the <year>s , this alliance was replaced by an alliance of elite workers and technological intellectuals against the peasants , culminating in the forced <unk> of agriculture in <year> . `` <unk> '' ideology ( the `` primacy of the forces of production '' ) , born in <unk> and fed by the interests of the `` worker <unk> '' and <unk> intellectuals , was <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> party , acting as a <unk> of new technocratic elites which established the same divisions of labor and social <unk> , as had capitalism . however , the `` legal '' <unk> , according to which the property of the state is defined as `` socialist , '' hides the actual exploitation . finally , bettelheim called into doubt the socialist character of the <month> revolution , interpreting it as a <unk> of power by a radical branch of the russian intelligentsia , which `` <unk> '' a popular <unk> was a leading proponent of the thesis that `` development '' in the countries of the `` third world '' <unk> a political break with <unk> and a <unk> from the bonds of <unk> on the unequal international division of labor of the world market . this position also includes a sharp criticism of the international role of the soviet union whose politics of development bettelheim saw as just another <unk> of capitalist accumulation models . this theory saw a chance for a <unk> of the political groundwork in order to practice an alternative development model , one that was not oriented towards accumulation and profit , but rather towards an economy for the everyday needs of the people , with a balanced proportion allowed between agriculture and industry . === decline of the marxist environment === when , in <year> , the people 's republic of china , under the leadership of deng xiaoping , put paid to the `` maoist '' strategy of <unk> ( <unk> . note : independent and self-sustaining ) development , guided by political <unk> , in order to <unk> the primacy of the economy and to introduce itself into the world market , the <unk> ' paradigm of autonomous development lost the force of its convictions . at the same time , marxism lost its influence , especially in france , where a wave of <unk> succeeded in discrediting not only the `` <unk> '' orthodoxy , but also marxist critics such as bettelheim . bettelheim , who had never abandoned marxist thinking , was condemned to disappear . in <year> , he published the two volumes of the third part of class struggle in the ussr , dedicated to the `` dominated '' and `` <unk> '' of stalinism , but the marxist

'' in those days boulding was actively involved in the quaker community , writing a pamphlet on <unk> methods in <year> and drafting a letter for the friends to the prime minister , asking britain to

made him view the firm as `` governed by a principle that might be called the homeostasis of the constant changing balance sheet '' . boulding ( <year> ) explained that : `` in the short run , the firm simply responded to changes in the balance sheet resulting from <unk> . when customers purchased finished goods , inventory went down , cash went up , and the cash would be spent on labour and materials to make more finished goods . this equilibrium balance sheet , however , would be constantly changing as technologies , new goods , and new enterprises came into play . `` : <unk> in <year> , in his second year in edinburgh , frank h. knight published an article on his work , entitled `` the theory of investment once more : mr. boulding and the austrians , '' in the quarterly journal of

to attend a world congress of quakers in philadelphia . he obtained a faculty position in <unk> new york at colgate university . : <integer> from <year> to <year> he taught economics there . <unk> ( <year> ) summarized his stay : ... boulding enjoyed the <unk> surroundings of colgate university . he did not feel <unk> from his colleagues and <unk> , as he had in british academic circles . for the first two years , social and professional life was fulfilling . but from <month> <year> , the invasion of poland and his home country 's declaration of war on germany caused increasing emotional distress and strong feelings of hate against the germans . his quaker convictions were shaken until he had a <unk> experience in <month> <year> which restored his faith in <unk> ... : <integer> in a state of spiritual crisis boulding managed to finish his textbook , economic analysis , which he had started in the free summer <unk> at colgate in the previous two years . this work would become a bestseller : <integer> and earned him even more respect in the field of economics . : <integer> from <year> to <year> , boulding taught at <unk> university , a historically black school in <unk> , tennessee . from <year> to <year> he was a faculty member of iowa state college , now iowa state university , and from <year> to <year> he was a faculty member of the university of michigan . in <year> he joined the faculty of the university of colorado at boulder , where he remained until his retirement . a number of national and regional scholarly societies elected boulding as their president , including the american economic association in <year>-69 , the society for general systems research , the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ) in <year> , the international studies association , the peace research society , and the association for the study of the grants economy . : <integer> in <year> larry d. <unk> stated : the election of kenneth boulding as <unk> of the aaas continues the tradition of selecting an individual who is not only distinguished because of significant and fundamental contributions to a particular field of science but who also has the knowledge and vision to look at science as a whole and accordingly to represent the entire scientific community . boulding was nominated for the nobel prize at different times for both peace and economics . === religious society of friends === boulding , with his wife elise , was an active member of the religious society of friends , or quakers . he took part in quaker <unk> , served on committees , and spoke to and about the friends . the two were members of meetings in <unk> , ann arbor , and boulder . although he usually <unk> , when he <unk> at a friends meeting , he spoke fluently . kenneth boulding was instrumental in organizing the first vietnam war <unk> at the university of michigan in <month> , <year>. he later spoke on the steps of the <unk> graduate library at the university and was <unk> with <unk> by a group of <unk> students . in <month> <year> , he conducted a silent <unk> at the headquarters of the american friends service committee in philadelphia to protest what he considered its <unk> itself from quakers . he <unk> the widely circulated `` there is a spirit '' , a series of sonnets he wrote in <year> based on the last statement of the <days> century quaker james <unk> . == work == boulding was widely recognized in academia as a prolific writer and an <unk> of knowledge . for boulding , economics and sociology were not social <unk> rather , they were all aspects of a single social science devoted to the study of human persons and their relationships ( organizations ) . boulding <unk> an evolutionary ( instead of equilibrium ) approach to economics . boulding emphasized that human economic and other behavior is embedded in a larger interconnected system . to understand the results of our behavior , economic or otherwise , we must first research and develop a scientific understanding of the <unk> of the general system , the global society in which we live , in all its dimensions spiritual and material . boulding believed that in the absence of a committed effort to the right kind of social science research and understanding , the human species might well be <unk> to extinction . but he was optimistic , believing our evolutionary journey had just begun . === economic analysis , <year> === boulding 's first major work in economics was his introductory textbook , entitled economic analysis . it was written when he was an instructor at colgate university in the <unk> and first appeared in <year> from harper & brothers in <unk> and two-volume editions . the book was <unk> and republished in four editions , the last in <year>. in a <year> book review , max millikan pointed out that the book was published at the right time and the right place . according to millikan : for some years there has been a <unk> gap in the literature of economic theory between the very elementary text designed for beginning students and the <unk> of specialized monographs and periodical articles accessible only to the fully trained economist . the teacher attempting to lead his charges over this difficult and dangerous <unk> has had to choose between two unsatisfactory alternatives . he could devote all his time to formal lecturing about a subject that requires informal discussion and problems for its proper comprehension ; or he could <unk> and discuss a <unk> of advanced books and articles in the hope , usually <unk> , that some fraction of the class would struggle through to a comprehension of some fraction of the material . millikan concluded that boulding 's work had filled the gap `` <unk> and effectively ... material is organized by tools of analysis and the problems in the solution of which those tools are useful rather than in the conventional manner '' . in the preface boulding had explained that the book was `` intended as a text from which the student can learn and the teacher can teach the methods and results of economic analysis . it also seeks to be a contribution to the development and <unk> of the body of economic analysis itself . `` looking back in <year> , boulding explained , that `` the first edition fundamentally followed irving fisher and keynes 's treatise on money . even though i had read keynes 's general theory by that time , i think i had not really understood it . i am not quite sure that i do now . the second edition , however , in <year> , was a <unk> keynesian general theory . `` : <integer> the first edition was published at the outbreak of world war ii and did not sell well , but the second revised edition did and became `` one of the core textbooks used in college in the united states ( and eventually around the world ) . `` : <integer> === evolutionary economics === boulding was an <unk> of the evolutionary economics movement . in his `` economic development as an evolutionary system '' ( <year> , <year> ) , boulding suggests a parallel between economic development and biological evolution . === the economics of the coming spaceship earth , <year> === following the publication of rachel carson 's silent spring in <year> , the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental <unk> . boulding in his influential <year> essay `` the economics of the coming spaceship earth '' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited <unk> of resources . == publications == boulding published some thirty books and more than eight hundred articles . === books === <year>s to <unk> , economic

attended milwaukee public schools , where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist . while attending middle school , simon wrote a letter to `` the editor of the milwaukee journal <unk> the civil liberties of <unk> '' . unlike most children , simon 's family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically ; his mother 's younger brother , harold <unk> ( <unk> ) , who studied economics at the university of wisconsin–madison under john r. commons , became one of his earliest influences . through harold 's books on economics and psychology , simon discovered social science . among his earliest influences , simon cited norman <unk> for his book the great illusion and henry george for his book progress and poverty . while attending high school , simon joined the debate team , where he argued `` from conviction , rather than <unk> '' in favor of george 's single <unk> <year> , simon entered the university of chicago , and , following his early influences , decided to study social science and mathematics . simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his `` <unk> and <unk> in

and economics . simon 's most important mentor was henry schultz , an econometrician and mathematical economist . simon received both his b.a .

( <year> ) in political science from the university of chicago , where he studied under harold <unk> , nicolas <unk> , rudolf <unk> , henry schultz , and charles edward <unk> . after enrolling in a course on `` measuring municipal governments , '' simon became a research assistant for clarence ridley , and the two co-authored measuring municipal activities : a survey of suggested criteria for <unk> administration in <year>. simon 's studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making , which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation . == career == after graduating with his undergraduate degree , simon obtained a research <unk> in municipal administration which turned into a directorship at the university of california , berkeley . from <year> to <year> , simon was a professor of political science and also served as department chairman at illinois institute of technology in chicago . there , he began participating in the seminars held by the staff of the cowles commission who at that time included trygve haavelmo , jacob marschak , and tjalling koopmans . he thus began an <unk> study of economics in the area of institutionalism . marschak brought simon in to assist in the study he was currently undertaking with sam <unk> of the `` prospective economic effects of atomic energy '' <unk> <year> to <year> , simon was a faculty member at carnegie-mellon university , in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . in <year> , simon became a professor of administration and chairman of the department of industrial management at carnegie institute of technology ( `` carnegie tech '' ) , which , in <year> , became carnegie-mellon university . simon later also taught psychology and computer science in the same university , ( occasionally visiting other universities ) . == research == seeking to replace the highly simplified classical approach to economic modeling , simon became best known for his theory of corporate decision in his book administrative behavior . in this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making . his organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman , but he also played a big part in the creation of the economic cooperation administration in <year> ; administrative team that administered aid to the marshall plan for the u.s. government , serving on president lyndon johnson 's science advisory committee , and also the national academy of science . simon has made a great number of contributions to both economic analysis and applications . because of this , his work can be found in a number of economic literary works , making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem , human rationality , behavioral study of firms , theory of <unk> ordering , and the analysis of the <unk> identification problem in econometrics . === decision-making === administrative behavior , first published in <year> and updated across the years , was based on simon 's doctoral dissertation . it served as the foundation for his life 's work . the <unk> of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational decisions . by his definition , an operational administrative decision should be correct , efficient , and practical to implement with a set of coordinated <unk> recognized that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making , and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology . he states : [ if ] there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be <unk> . it would consist of the single <unk> : always select that alternative , among those available , which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals . ( p <unk> ) contrary to the `` <unk> <unk> '' <unk> , simon argued that alternatives and consequences <month> be partly known , and means and ends <unk> <unk> , <unk> related , or <unk> <unk> defined the task of rational decision making is to select the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences . <unk> of administrative decisions was thus measured by : adequacy of achieving the desired objective efficiency with which the result was <unk> task of choice was divided into three required steps : identifying and listing all the alternatives determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives ; comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of <unk> given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to <unk> with the three requirements . simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives , or all consequences that follow from each alternative is impossible in many realistic <unk> attempted to determine the techniques and/or behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making . simon writes : the human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties . these procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences . therefore , simon describes work in terms of an economic framework , conditioned on human cognitive limitations : economic man and administrative man . administrative behavior addresses a wide range of human behaviors , cognitive abilities , management techniques , personnel policies , training goals and procedures , specialized roles , criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency , and all of the ramifications of communication processes . simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions , both directly and <unk> argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy , but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was <unk> followed chester barnard , who stated `` the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions '' . personal choices <month> be determined whether an individual <unk> a particular organization and continue to be made in his or her <unk> private life . as a member of an organization , however , that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results , but in an <unk> sense as part of the organizational intent , purpose , and effect . organizational <unk> , rewards , and sanctions are all designed to form , strengthen , and maintain this <unk> saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals : authority ( addressed in chapter <unk> role of authority ) and in loyalties and identification ( addressed in chapter x : loyalties , and organizational identification ) . authority is a <unk> , primary mark of organizational behavior , <unk> defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank . the actions , attitudes , and relationships of the dominant and <unk> individuals constitute components of role behavior that <month> vary widely in form , style , and content , but do not vary in the expectation of <unk> by the one of superior status , and willingness to obey from the <unk> was defined by simon as the `` process whereby the individual <unk> organizational objectives ( service objectives or conservation objectives ) for his own aims as the <unk> which determine his organizational decisions '' . this <unk> evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for <unk> or one 's <unk> can be complex <unk> of facts and values . information about facts , especially <unk> facts or facts derived from specialized experience , are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values . simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values . following <unk> , he states that `` a person identifies himself with a group when , in making a decision , he <unk> the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the <unk> group '' . a person <month> identify himself with any number of social , geographic , economic , racial , religious , <unk> , educational , gender , political , and sports groups . indeed , the number and variety are unlimited . the fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group <unk> <month> either facilitate or <unk> correct decision making for the organization . a specific organization has to determine deliberately , and <unk> in appropriate detail and clear language , its own goals , objectives , means , ends , and <unk> has been critical of traditional economics ' elementary understanding of decision-making , and argues it `` is too quick to build an idealistic , unrealistic picture of the decision-making process and then <unk> on the basis of such unrealistic picture '' <unk> simon rediscovered path diagrams , which were originally invented by sewall wright around <year> . === artificial intelligence === simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence , creating with allen newell the logic theory machine ( <year> ) and the general problem solver ( gps ) ( <year> ) programs . gps <month> possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems . both programs were developed using the information processing language ( <unk> ) ( <year> ) developed by newell , cliff shaw , and simon . donald <unk> mentions the development of list processing in <unk> , with the linked list originally called `` <unk> memory '' for its inventors . in <year> , simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within `` ten years '' when , in reality , that transition took about forty years.in the early <year>s psychologist <unk> <unk> asserted that while machines are capable of <unk> `` cold cognition '' behaviors such as reasoning , planning , <unk> , and deciding , they would never be able to <unk> `` hot cognition '' behaviors such as pain , <unk> , desire , and other emotions . simon responded to <unk> 's views in <year> by writing a paper on emotional cognition , which he updated in <year> and published in psychological review . simon 's work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years , but subsequent work on emotions by <unk> and <unk> helped <unk> attention on simon 's paper and eventually , made it highly influential on the <unk> also collaborated with james g. <month> on several works in organization <unk> allen newell , simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules . the study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and , with anders ericsson , simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis . simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise . he said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly <other>0,000 chunks of information . a chess expert was said to have learned about <other>0,000 chunks or chess position <unk> was awarded the acm turing award , along with allen newell , in <year> . `` in joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years , initially in collaboration with j. c. ( cliff ) shaw at the rand corporation , and <unk> [ sic ] with numerous faculty and student colleagues at carnegie mellon university , they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence , the psychology of human cognition , and list processing . '' === psychology === simon was interested in how humans learn and , with edward <unk> , he developed the epam ( elementary <unk> and <unk> ) theory , one of the first theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program . epam was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning . later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise . with fernand <unk> , he has expanded the epam theory into the <unk> computational model . the theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of <unk> , which are more complex structures . <unk> has been used predominantly , to simulate aspects of chess expertise . === sociology and economics === simon has been credited for revolutionary changes in microeconomics . he is responsible for the concept of organizational decision-making as it is known today . he was the first to <unk> examine how administrators made decisions when they did not have perfect and complete information . it was in this area that he was awarded the nobel prize in <year>.at the cowles commission , simon 's main goal was to link economic theory to mathematics and statistics . his main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics . he was greatly influenced by the <unk> debate that began in the <year>s . the popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent <unk> that entrepreneurs needed to follow the <unk> principles of <unk> in running organizations . the argument went on to note that profit maximization was not accomplished , in part , because of the lack of complete information . in decision-making , simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present . these factors limit the extent to which agents <month> make a fully rational decision , thus they possess only `` bounded rationality '' and must make decisions by `` <unk> '' , or choosing that which might not be optimal , but which will make them happy enough . bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics . it is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision . theories of bounded rationality <unk> one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory . further , simon emphasized that psychologists <unk> a `` procedural '' definition of rationality , whereas economists employ a `` <unk> '' definition . <unk> <unk> argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality . however , in an earlier article , bhargava ( <year> ) noted the importance of simon 's arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the `` procedural '' definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health . in particular , economists should employ `` auxiliary assumptions '' that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields , and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes . simon was also known for his research on industrial organization . he determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions <unk> , did not <unk> to the neoclassical theories of `` rational '' decision-making . simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life , mainly focusing on the issue of decision-making within the behavior of what he termed `` bounded rationality '' . `` rational behavior , in economics , means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face ( e.g. , their budget <unk> , limited choices , ... ) in pursuit of their self-interest . this is reflected in the theory of subjective expected utility . the term , bounded rationality , is used to <unk> rational choice that takes into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity . bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics . it is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision-making process influences decisions . theories of bounded rationality <unk> one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory '' <unk> determined that the best way to study these areas was through computer simulations . as such , he developed an interest in computer science . simon 's main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence , <unk> interaction , principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems , the use of computers to study ( by modeling ) philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of epistemology , and the social implications of computer <unk> his youth , simon took an interest in land economics and <unk> , an idea known at the time as `` single tax '' . the system is meant to <unk> <unk> economic rent to the public and improve land use . in <year> , simon still maintained these ideas and argued that land value tax should replace taxes on <unk> of simon 's economic research was directed toward understanding technological change in general and the information processing revolution in particular . === pedagogy === simon 's work has strongly influenced john <unk> , developer of a program that has achieved significant success in improving mathematics performance among elementary and high school students . <unk> <unk> a <year> paper by simon and two coauthors that <unk> arguments by french mathematics educator , guy <unk> , and others suggesting that excessive practice <unk> children 's understanding : [ the ] criticism of practice ( called `` drill and kill , '' as if this phrase constituted empirical evaluation ) is prominent in <unk> writings . nothing flies more in the face of the last <integer> years of research than the assertion that practice is bad . all evidence , from the laboratory and from extensive case studies of professionals , indicates that real competence only comes with extensive practice ... in denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence . the <unk> task is not to `` kill '' motivation by demanding drill , but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest . == awards and honors == simon received many <unk> honors in life , including becoming a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in <year> ; election as a member of the national academy of sciences in <year> ;

'' according to friedman , stigler `` essentially created a new area of study for economists . '' stigler stressed the importance of information : `` one should hardly have to tell <unk> that information is a valuable resource : knowledge is power . and yet it <unk> a slum <unk> in the town of economics . `` his <year> article `` information in the labor market '' developed the theory of search unemployment . in <year> he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical <unk> was known for his sharp sense of <unk> , and he wrote a number of <unk> essays . in his book the intellectual and the <unk> , for instance , he proposed stigler 's law of demand and supply <unk> : `` all demand <unk> are inelastic and all supply <unk> are inelastic too . '' the essay <unk> studies that found many goods and services to be inelastic over the long run and offered a supposed theoretical proof ; he ended by announcing that his next essay would demonstrate that the price system does not exist . another essay , `` a sketch on the truth in teaching , '' described the consequences of a ( fictional ) set of court decisions that held universities <unk> responsible for the consequences of teaching errors . the stigler diet is also named after him . stigler wrote numerous articles on the history of economics , published in the leading journals and republished <integer> of them in <year>. the american economic review said , `` many of these essays have become such well-known <unk> that no scholar in this field should be unfamiliar with them ... the lucid prose , penetrating logic , and <unk> <unk> ... have become the author 's trademarks . `` stigler was a founding member of the mont pelerin society and was its president from <year> to <year>. he was a <unk> <unk> received national medal of science in <year> . == bibliography == ( [ <year> ] <year> ) . production and distribution theories : the formative period . new york : macmillan . preview .

alexander nikolaevich yakovlev ( russian : алекса́ндр <unk> <unk> ; <integer> <month> <year> – <integer> <month> <year> ) was a soviet and russian politician and historian . during the <year>s he was a member of the politburo and secretariat of the communist party of the soviet union . he was called the `` godfather of glasnost '' as he is considered to be the intellectual force behind mikhail gorbachev 's reform program of glasnost and perestroika . yakovlev was the first soviet politician to acknowledge the existence of the secret <unk> of the <year> <unk> pact with nazi germany . == early career == the first child of five , yakovlev was born to a peasant family in a tiny village , <unk> , on the <unk> river , near yaroslavl . he had four sisters , two of whom died in infancy . his father nikolai <unk> only attended school for four years and his mother <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , for three months . yakovlev was <unk> in childhood and suffered from <unk> . his father served in the red <unk> during the civil war and was fully committed to the communist regime ; he became the first chairman of a local collective farm . their house was set <unk> while he was seven and the family moved to <unk> <unk> . yakovlev graduated from secondary school days before nazi germany invaded the soviet union . he was drafted into the red army in <month> <year> , with brief training , and was promoted to lieutenant in a rifle platoon during the war . he served as a platoon commander in <unk> front . on <month> <integer> , <year> , he was leading <integer> <unk> peasants and was ordered to charge german positions in <unk> near leningrad and was badly wounded . he was hospitalized until <month> <year> , and almost required an <unk> , but was saved at the last moment . he became a member of the communist party of the soviet union in <year>. at this time he regarded the communist party as `` life 's truth '' and affirmed he was totally loyal and <unk> to soviet union , and he was an <unk> admirer of stalin . in <month> <year> , he resumed education at the yaroslavl pedagogical institute to study history . on <month> <integer> , <year> , he married nina <unk> <unk> . he graduated the same year and went to moscow to attend the higher party school . in <month> <year> , he was appointed the instructor of the department of propaganda and <unk> in yaroslavl , a post he held for a year and a half . shortly after this , he had his first doubts about the regime , when he was shocked to see train after train carrying soviet <unk> being sent to labor camps . at the <unk> train station , he saw <unk> women and was dis<month>ed at how they were treated . this memory troubled him deeply and never left him . in <month> <year> , shortly after stalin 's death , he was assigned to the party 's central committee as an instructor in the department of schools . on <month> <integer> , <year> , khrushchev 's secret speech became the most traumatic event in yakovlev 's early moscow life ; he listened to the speaker from the <unk> in the large kremlin palace . after the <days> party congress , yakovlev lost his previous enthusiasm for communism and led a double life . he wanted to turn to the original sources on <unk> , <unk> , lenin , german philosophers , french and italian socialists and british economists . he asked to leave the central committee to enroll in the academy of social sciences of the central committee . while twice refused , he was finally allowed to study there for two years and became convinced that <unk> was <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as a <unk> fraud . this <unk> his internal political conflict following the <days> party congress . he began to agree with <unk> in <year> , he was chosen as a fulbright exchange student at columbia university in the united states for one year . of the seventeen soviet students , fourteen were selected by the kgb . yakovlev and three others , all kgb personnel , including <unk> <unk> , went to columbia . he studied <unk> the english language , roosevelt and the new deal , drawing connections between the us at that time and the ussr . at the end , in <month> <year> , the soviet <unk> were taken on a <unk> tour of the us , during which he stayed with us families from vermont , chicago and iowa . as a result , he began to view perestroika as a <unk> of the new deal to save communism , as roosevelt had saved capitalism . however , his year in america did little to <unk> his <unk> because of the greed , racism , and other things that he witnessed . yakovlev returned to the central committee to work on ideology and propaganda , and published several <unk> books . he defended a dissertation dealing with the historiography of us foreign policy , and received the degree of <unk> nauk , the equivalent of a doctorate , in <month> <year>. in <month> <year> , he was appointed the first deputy head of the propaganda department of the central committee of the cpsu by leonid brezhnev . in <month> <year> , yakovlev was sent to prague as the representative of cpsu central committee , and witnessed the entry of tanks into the city . he later spoke out against <unk> <unk> . that same year , he was placed in command of a group charged with drafting the new constitution . yakovlev served as editor of several party publications and rose to the key position of head of the cpsu 's department of ideology and propaganda from <year> to <year>. in <month> <year> , he visited the us again and met ronald reagan , henry kissinger , and jane <unk> , who warned him that moscow `` did not appreciate the full danger of american <unk> '' . this trip , again , failed to change his unfavorable impression with us . in <year> , he took a bold stand by publishing the article entitled `` against <unk> '' in <unk> gazeta , critical of russian nationalism , and nationalism in the soviet union in general . as a result , he was removed from his position . given the choice of a diplomatic post as exile , he chose to be the ambassador to canada , remaining at that post for a decade . he arrived in canada in <month> <year> . during this time , he and canadian prime minister pierre trudeau became close friends . trudeau 's second son , <unk> trudeau , was given the russian nickname `` <unk> '' after <unk> <month> <integer> to <integer> , <year> , yakovlev accompanied mikhail gorbachev , who at the time was the soviet official in charge of agriculture , on his tour of canada . the purpose of the visit was to tour canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the soviet union . however , the two also renewed their earlier friendship and , <unk> at first , began to discuss the prospect of <unk> in the soviet union . in an interview years later , yakovlev recalled : at first we kind of <unk> around each other and our conversations did n't touch on serious issues . and then , <unk> , history plays <unk> on one , we had a lot of time together as guests of then liberal minister of agriculture eugene <unk> in canada who , himself , was too late for the reception because he was <unk> with some striking farmers somewhere . so we took a long walk on that minister 's farm and , as it often happens , both of us suddenly were just kind of <unk> and let go . i somehow , for some reason , threw <unk> to the wind and started telling him about what i considered to be <unk> <unk> in the area of foreign affairs , especially about those ss-20 missiles that were being stationed in europe and a lot of other things . and he did the same thing . we were completely frank . he frankly talked about the problems in the internal situation in russia . he was saying that under these conditions , the conditions of dictatorship and absence of freedom , the country would simply <unk> . so it was at that time , during our <unk> conversation , almost as if our heads were <unk> together , that we <unk> it all out and during that <unk> conversation we actually came to agreement on all our main points . two weeks after the visit , as a result of gorbachev 's interventions , yakovlev was recalled from canada by yuri andropov and became director of the institute of world economy and international relations of the ussr academy of sciences in moscow on <month> <integer> , <year> ; he was succeeded by his friend yevgeny <unk> in <year>. although he was impressed with canada 's free , competitive <unk> in agriculture , the <unk> part for the <unk> the benefits of rule of law , yakovlev published a <unk> called poor santa <unk> , or the police eye of democracy allegedly <unk> canadian totalitarian practices under the pseudonym n. <unk> . it described how capitalism created `` its <unk> serve - a system of repression , <unk> and terror '' , how it `` <unk> its citizens '' , how the united states `` <unk> its <unk> '' , and that canada was really a totalitarian police state with a democratic <unk> . == perestroika and its aftermath == when gorbachev became general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union in <year> , yakovlev became a senior advisor , helping to shape soviet foreign policy by advocating soviet <unk> in eastern europe , and accompanying gorbachev on his five summit meetings with president of the united states ronald reagan . in the summer of <year> , yakovlev became head of the propaganda department of the cpsu central committee . <unk> , he argued in favor of the reform programs that became known as glasnost ( openness ) and perestroika ( restructuring ) and played a key role in <unk> those policies . after the <unk> congress , in an <unk> circle of our closest friends and associates , we often discussed the problems of democratization of the country and society . we chose a simple - like a <unk> - method of <unk> the `` ideas '' of late lenin . a group of true , not <unk> <unk> developed ( of course , <unk> ) the following plan : to strike with the authority of lenin at stalin , at stalinism . and then , if successful , - to strike with plekhanov and social democracy - at lenin , and then – with liberalism and `` moral socialism '' - at

director of its center for business and government from <year> to <year> . dunlop also played an active role in solving problems at the university . during a critical period in its history following the police bust in <year> and subsequent <unk> of the university , dunlop played a crucial role in restoring stability to the institution , leading a student faculty committee through a process to resolve the conflict and ultimately to introduce governance reforms . following nathan <unk> 's resignation as president , he then served as dean and as a close advisor to president derek bok during the <unk> period of the vietnam war , settling disputes between students , faculty , and the harvard administration . bok commented `` he probably saved this university at a very critical time after the student riots in <year>-69 '' with `` leadership and a <unk> head . `` many years later , following a highly contentious series of organizing efforts , a new union was elected at harvard to represent clerical and technical workers . in light of the <unk> that accompanied harvard 's campaign against <unk> , harvard president derek bok tapped dunlop to lead the university 's management negotiation team . dunlop negotiated with the president of the newly formed harvard union of clerical and technical workers union , <unk> <unk> , what is widely regarded as an innovative collective

industry . he served on the wage stabilization board from <year> to <year> , experience that would decades later encourage the nixon administration to put him in charge of efforts to <unk> setting wages and price controls . in <year> , dunlop replaced donald h. <unk> as director of the cost of living council . == political life == in <month> <year> , president gerald ford selected dunlop as his first secretary of labor . dunlop focused on a variety of efforts that sought to bring the idea of multi-party problem solving to the regulatory process , and in implementing labor policies . his views on the importance of government policy in <unk> agreements among parties rather than through direct regulatory authority were laid out in his article `` the limits of legal <unk> '' . in that article , dunlop notes : the country needs to acquire a more realistic understanding of the limitations on bringing about social change through legal <unk> . a great deal of government time needs to be devoted to improving understanding , persuasion , accommodation , mutual problem solving , and information mediation . legislation , <unk> , and regulations are useful means for some social and economic problems , but today government has more regulation on its plate than it can handle . the desire to bring parties together to solve problems led dunlop to resign as secretary of labor . the construction industry remained an ongoing focus of dunlop due to its important role in the us economy and particularly the potential of collective bargaining agreements in that industry to have inflationary pressures in the larger economies . building trades unions sought changes in the national labor relations act ( nlra ) to reflect the distinctive problems of that sector in regard to rules regarding union recognition , organizing and the rights to <unk> . through ongoing negotiations between trade union leaders and leading contractors and construction end users , dunlop crafted an agreement between the parties that would amend the nlra in ways sought by unions in exchange for their agreement along with management to longer term industry reforms , in a bill that would move in

relations act and related federal laws regarding workplace representation and recommend changes to them . differences among commission members and the <unk> election of <year> that brought a republican majority to the house of representatives <unk> action on many of the dunlop commission 's recommendations . dunlop nonetheless went on to work on promoting negotiated <unk> for workplace health and safety and crafted an agreement between the occupational safety and health administration , the national association of home builders and the building trades council ( afl-cio ) regarding health and safety standards for residential construction . === dispute resolution in multiple fields === along with his service in government , dunlop practiced dispute resolution in a variety of other areas , pioneering innovative multi-party agreements in a variety of areas . in agriculture , he <unk> in an <unk> dispute between the campbell soup company , the farm labor organizing committee ( <unk> , an afl-cio <unk> that organized farm workers in the <unk> ) and <unk> growers in michigan and ohio regarding conditions of work among the <unk> workers who worked for growers supplying campbell 's with <unk> . since agricultural workers are <unk> from the nlra , private sector employers are not <unk> to recognize unions . in addition , the farm workers were treated as independent contractors to the individual growers supplying campbell soup . growers contended that the prices received for their <unk> <unk> increases in wages or provision of better housing conditions in labor camps . in <year> , campbell soup approached dunlop to assist them in settling the dispute . dunlop brought together the parties and <unk> an agreement ending the corporate campaign in exchange for union representation among <unk> growers , including a mechanism for union recognition and dispute resolution through a commission chaired by dunlop and an equal number of representatives of labor and growers . the agreement also provided growers higher prices in exchange for agreement to bargaining with the union . as a result , the agreement created a private system of union recognition , collective bargaining and dispute resolution accepted by the parties . the agreement soon expanded to include <unk> growers and the food <unk> <unk> and dean foods and has been renewed consistently to the present . in <year> , an agreement between <unk> and the north carolina growers association extending the dunlop agricultural commission model was signed providing the only collective bargaining agreement covering guest workers from <unk> <year> , dunlop and harvard university colleague frederick h. abernathy ( gordon <unk> research professor of mechanical engineering and <unk> and james lawrence research professor of engineering ) , a professor of fluid mechanics , were commissioned by the <unk> clothing and textile workers union to undertake a summer study of the <unk> of the men 's suit industry . the study focused on the need to encourage research and development on the creation ( and later the adoption ) of technology in the textile and clothing sector . eventually dunlop 's and abernathy 's efforts led to the creation of the <unk> clothing and technology corporation [ tc ] <integer> , a <unk> organization , funded <unk> the three parties . [ tc ] <integer> initially funded development of new technologies for the industry . it later turned to a broader focus on encouraging the use of existing technology among clothing manufacturers and textile producers .

start_of_passage > <month>o boal ( <integer> <month> <year> – <integer> <month> <year> ) was a brazilian theatre practitioner , drama theorist , and political activist . he was the founder of theatre of the oppressed , a theatrical form originally used in radical left popular education movements . boal served one term as a <unk> ( the brazilian equivalent of a city councillor ) in rio de janeiro from <year> to <year> , where he developed legislative theatre . == biography == === early life === <month>o boal studied at columbia university in new york with the critic john <unk> . <unk> introduced boal to the techniques of both <unk> <unk> and konstantin <unk> , and encouraged boal to form links with theatre groups like the black experimental theatre . in <year> boal staged productions of two of his own plays , the horse and the saint and the house across the street . in <year> , shortly after graduating , boal was asked to work with the arena theatre in são paulo , southeast brazil . boal was in charge of directing plays along with other <unk> such as josé <unk> , who was also the founder of the arena theatre . it was here that he began to experiment with new forms of theatre never before seen in brazil , such as <unk> 's <unk> ' for actors , with which he became familiar during his time at columbia and when involved with the actors studio in new york . boal adapted these methods to social conditions in brazil , taking a leftist approach on issues concerning nationalism , which were very much in <unk> at that time period since the country had just undergone a long period of military dictatorship . === work at the arena theatre of são paulo === while working at the arena theatre in são paulo , boal directed a number of classical <unk> , which he transformed to make them more <unk> to brazilian society and its economy . among these plays was john <unk> 's of mice and men , known in brazil as <unk> e <unk> . this was boal 's first performance as a director at the arena theatre of são paulo . critics <unk> this piece and boal won the prêmio de <unk> de <unk> ( direction revelation award ) from the association of art critics of são paulo , in <year>. in the early sixties , the ratings at the arena theatre of são paulo started to drop , almost causing the theatre to go bankrupt . consequently , the company decided to start investing in national theatre ( pieces written by brazilian <unk> ) as a move that could possibly save it from <unk> . the new investment proved to be a success , opening up the path for a national theatre scene . boal then suggested the creation of a seminar in <unk> at the arena theatre , which was quickly implemented and soon became a national platform for many young <unk> . many successful productions were born from this seminar and now form part of the arena theatre of são paulo 's nationalist phase <unk> . one of these productions was <unk> <unk> <unk> , written by <unk> <unk> <unk> in <year> and directed by <month>o boal . === exile === a new military regime started in brazil in <year> with a coup d'état supported by the brazilian elite , the <unk> , the military , as well as by the united states , boal 's teachings were controversial , and as a cultural activist he was seen as a threat by the brazilian military regime . in <year> , boal was kidnapped off the street , arrested , tortured , and eventually exiled to argentina , where he stayed for five years . during those five years , boal published two books : torquemada ( <year> ) and his much <unk> theatre of the oppressed ( <year> ) . torquemada is about the brazilian military regime 's systematic use of torture in prison . boal takes the name of the leading figure of the spanish <unk> , tomas de torquemada , as an example of historical forms of systematic torture . in theatre of the oppressed boal develops a theatrical method based on pedagogy of the oppressed , a book by the brazilian educator and writer paulo freire ( who was also a good friend of boal ) <unk> 's method ( which has been implemented in various communities around the world ) seeks to transform audiences into active participants in the theatrical experience . boal argues that traditional theatre is oppressive since spectators usually do not get a chance to express themselves and that a collaboration between both parties , in contrast , allows spectators to perform actions that are socially liberating . the method , as boal liked to explain , seeks to transform spectators into `` <unk> . '' when the political climate in brazil forced boal into exile in <year> , he initially went to peru and then argentina , where he completed and published his seminal theoretical work the theatre of the oppressed and consolidated his <unk> ( <unk> ) theatre work based on the idea of brazilian educationalist paulo freire . freire 's methods were a revolt against the <unk> `` <unk> '' approach to education and he advocated <unk> education models . boal 's work in peru with the <unk> project , a movement which sought to use a range of languages including `` artistic languages '' to <unk> <unk> , developed his ideas and methodology away from the <unk> of his brazilian arena theatre days and sought to engage theatre as a pedagogical tool . crucial to this time was boal 's attempts to break down the divisions between spectator and actor . it is around this time that invented the term `` <unk> '' , a term that he saw as establishing the <unk> within which he wished to work . he saw that the <unk> of the spectator could be broken down by the following steps by which the spectator becomes the <unk> : knowing the body ( by body he means both the individual `` body '' and the collective `` body '' in a marxist sense ) making the body <unk> using theatre as a language using theatre as <unk> living in argentina , boal travelled to other countries in south america such as peru and ecuador , where he worked with people in small and usually poor communities that dealt with conflicts such as civil wars and lack of government attention . boal was of the opinion that only the oppressed are able to free the oppressed . in peru , boal practiced his forum theatre method , in which spectator <unk> actor to determine the solution to a given problem presented by the actor , which can also be a real problem someone in the community is facing . boal also lived in paris , france , for a number of years , where he created several centers for the theatre of the oppressed , directed plays , and also taught classes at the sorbonne university . boal created the first international festival for the theatre of the oppressed in <unk> boal was in exile , his very close friend and brazilian musician <unk> <unk> wrote him a letter that would later result in the <unk> hit called `` <unk> caro <unk> '' or `` my dear friend '' ( <year> ) . in this song , <unk> tells his friend about the situation in brazil at the time , addressing the military dictatorship in a very <unk> but <unk> way ( due to <unk> issues , many artists could not express themselves freely ) . the <unk> of the song is very happy and <unk> while the <unk> explain : my dear friend , <unk> <unk> me , if i can ’ t pay you a visit , but since i found someone to carry a message , i ’ m sending you news on this tape . here we play football , there ’ s lots of <unk> , lots of <unk> and rock ’ <unk> . some days it <unk> , some days it ’ s <unk> but i want to tell you that things here are pretty dark . here , we ’ re <unk> and dealing for survival , and we ’ re only surviving because we ’ re <unk> . and everyone ’ s drinking because without <unk> , nobody <unk> this <unk> . === center for the theatre of the <unk> === after the fall of the military dictatorship , boal returned to brazil after <integer> years of exile in <year>. he established a major center for the theatre of the oppressed in rio de janeiro ( <unk> ) , whose objective was to study , discuss and express issues concerning citizenship , culture and various forms of oppression using theatrical language . boal 's work in the <unk> made way for the approval of a new law that <unk> crime victims and witnesses in brazil . boal 's group has worked next to numerous organizations that fight for human rights . in <year> , boal ran for city councillor in rio de janeiro as a theatrical act , and he was elected . boal 's support staff was his theatre group , with whom he quickly developed various legislative proposals . his objective was to work out issues citizens might be facing in their communities through theatre and also to discuss the laws of the city of rio with people on the streets . after having worked to transform spectator into author in theatre of the oppressed , boal <unk> the legislative theatre movement process , in which <unk> becomes <unk> . boal is known to say that he did not create laws <unk> while he was city councillor . instead , he asked people what they wanted . other politicians were not very fond of this . out of <integer> of boal 's proposed laws , only <integer> got approved during his term as councillor of rio de janeiro . his term ended in <year> , but he continued performing legislative theatre acts with different groups in <unk> , where four more laws got approved even after boal had left . boal also worked with prisoners in rio and são paulo . boal argued that people in prison are not free in space , but that they are in time , and that the theatre of the oppressed <unk> to create different types of freedom so that people are able to imagine and think about the past , the present , and <unk> the future instead of having to <unk> for it . all this was in order for prisoners to have `` a <unk> and more creative lifestyle . '' people in the <unk> <unk> terra or <unk> workers movement of brazil also experienced working with boal 's theatre methods . boal 's son <unk> worked along with his father and now continues to take the theatre of the oppressed to various communities in brazil and around the world . in <month> <year> , he received the title of `` world theatre ambassador '' from unesco . === death === <month>o boal died on <integer> <month> <year> at the age of <integer> in rio de janeiro . critic <unk> <unk> argues that <month>o boal is the best-known and most respected brazilian theatre practitioner abroad . == influences == most of <month>o boal 's techniques were created after he realized the limitations of <unk> , politically motivated theatre in the poor areas where he worked . he found that his attempts to inspire the people living in poor or `` slum '' areas to rise up against racial and class inequality were inhibited by his own racial and class background , since he was white and comparatively financially comfortable , as well as his and his colleagues ' <unk> to perform violence themselves . his new techniques allowed the idea of <unk> and the impetus for change to come from within the target group . much of his early work and teaching was inspired by marxist philosophy , although much of his work now falls within the boundaries of a <unk> ideology . paulo freire was a major influence on boal 's teachings . he and freire became close in later years . when freire died , boal said : `` i am very <unk> . i have lost my last father . now all i have are brothers and sisters '' <unk> was also known to quote william <unk> 's hamlet , in which hamlet argues that theatre is like a mirror that reflects our virtues and <unk> equally . although boal found this quote beautiful , he liked to think of theatre as a mirror in which one can reach in to change reality and to transform it . == published works == === theatre of the oppressed ( london : <unk> press , <year> ) === arguably <month>o boal 's most academically influential work is the theatre of the oppressed , in which the reader follows boal 's detailed analysis of the <unk> of <unk> and the early history of western theatre . boal <unk> that the <unk> <unk> means <unk> the masses , the people , the workers and the spectators in favour of stability and the continued dominance of a <unk> few . he argues that the <unk> , a <unk> drama style that today could be considered similar to that of <unk> <unk> , <unk> the state promote its continued existence . he sees the brazilian government as an example of an oppressive state using theatre to propagate its oppressive system . he then <unk> his early theories and practices for attempting to reverse the paradigm . it also talks about newspaper theatre , attempting to talk about local problems and present it to the audiences , forum theatre , currently used in over <integer> countries , invisible theatre , used to discuss political activity and image theatre . theatre of the oppressed has been translated to more than <integer> languages over the years . boal also talks about invisible theatre in which an event is planned and <unk> but does not allow the spectators to know that the event is happening . actors perform out of the ordinary roles which <unk> spectators to join in or sit back and watch . one example was in a <unk> at the <unk> hotel , actors sat at separate tables and informed the <unk> in <unk> voices that they could not eat the food . the actor stated that the food was not good . the <unk> says the <unk> could <unk> something else to eat . so the actor chose a rather expensive item off the <unk> and says he will be able to pay for it . the actor mentions he has no money and he would be willing to work for it . this display made other <unk> start discussing the price and treatment of workers at this hotel . this act allowed spectators to think about issues that were going on but was <unk> over because the issue did not directly involve them . analytical theatre is when a participant tells a story and the actors <unk> it . each character is broken down into all the social roles they could follow and the participants choose an object to <unk> the role . this aspect of theatre allows the participants to see how there are multiple roles a person could follow . === games for actors and <unk> ( london : routledge , <year> ; second edition <year> ) === this is probably <month>o boal 's most practically influential book , in which he sets down a brief explanation of his theories , mostly through stories and examples of his work in europe , and then explains every drama exercise that he has found useful in his practice . in contrast to theatre of the oppressed , it contains little academic theory and many practical examples for drama practitioners to use even if not <unk> theatre that is related to boal 's academic or political ideas . boal refers to many of these as `` <unk> '' , as they combine the training and `` <unk> '' of exercises with the fun and `` <unk> '' of games . it has been influential in the development of community theatre and theatre in education ( <unk> . ) practices worldwide , especially in europe and south america . these games include <unk> in rio and your friend is dead . === the <unk> of desire : the boal method of theatre and therapy . ( london : routledge , <year> ) === this book <unk> the practices commonly associated with the theatre of the oppressed for a new purpose . it has been argued that boal <unk> himself with this take on his work , as it mostly concerns itself with creating harmony within society , whereas his early work was concerned with <unk> and <unk> . boal states that , `` theatre is the passionate combat of two human beings on a platform . '' however , boal 's works can be seen as a progression and exploration of a left wing world view rather than a unified theory . in the context of those <unk> in a society , his methodology can be used as a weapon against oppressors . in the context of those in a society who are in need of <unk> for the sake of their own integration into it , it can be switched round to <unk> that individual to break down internal <unk> that separate that individual from society . through his work at french institutions for the mentally ill and elsewhere in europe , where he discovered concepts such as the `` cop in the head '' , the theories presented in this book have been useful in the pioneering field of drama therapy and have been applied by drama practitioners . boal states in his work that there are three properties of the <unk> space . first , is plasticity . he says that one can be without being . objects can acquire different meaning such as an old chair representing a king 's <unk> . he states that only duration counts and location can be changed . second , is that the <unk> space is <unk> and it creates <unk> . this idea suggests that there is a space within a space . the stage is in front of the audience and the actor is creating his own space . third , is <unk> . this idea creates the idea that it is impossible to hide on stage . every aspect of the space is seen and it makes the far away close-up . === other books === legislative theatre : using performance to make politics . london : routledge , <year> . hamlet and the baker 's son : my life in theatre and politics . london : routledge , <unk> the <unk> of the oppressed . london : routledge , <year> . == recognition == in <year> , boal won the unesco <unk> <unk> medal , and in <month> <year> , he was awarded the `` career achievement award '' by the association of theatre in higher education at their national conference in chicago , illinois . boal is also seen as the inspiration behind <days>-century forms of <unk> , such as the `` <unk> theatrical laboratories '' . boal received the cross border award for peace and democracy by <unk> institute of technology in <year>. boal has in many ways influenced many artists in new media with his participatory modes of expression , especially as the world wide web has become such a powerful tool for participation and communication . notable examples include learning to love you more , <unk> , and steve lambert 's why they hate us . == see also == applied drama community theatre paulo freire <unk> theatre == references == == external links == media related to <month>o boal at wikimedia commons quotations related to <month>o boal at wikiquote international theatre institute – author of the world theatre day message <year> <month>o boal international theatre of the oppressed organisation . theatre of the oppressed laboratory – new york city worked with boal from <year> <month>o boal interview on democracy now !

[ <integer> ] here anatoly did well at secondary school , gaining only excellent marks when he graduated in <year>. he immediately enrolled for the tashkent state technical university but was called up for military service almost immediately . [ <integer> ] whilst in the army his exceptional abilities brought him to the attention of <unk> <unk> who ordered him to <unk> in the high artillery school in leningrad . in the end of <month> <year> kitov and his fellow students had to <unk> their learning and were <unk> sent to the front . however kitov was already an officer , a lieutenant . later kitov became a commander of the whole anti-aircraft <unk> , with <integer> guns . <unk> between battles anatoly kitov filled with studying mathematics and other university subjects . in <year> he performed his first analytic work , he proposed new method of anti aircraft shooting . that time he was at <integer> years old . kitov ’ s study of university subjects helped him gain in <month> <year> entry to the f.e . dzerzhinsky artillery academy ( one of the ussr best military universities ) to the faculty of rocket <unk> , <unk> the first academic year so as to start in the second . a.i . kitov was the chairman of scientific society of the academy ’ s students . during his <unk> in the academy he himself was also working upon development of a rocket weapon of new type . the ussr state committee on inventions awarded him an `` author ’ s certificate on the invention '' ( patent ) . his project proposal on new <unk> weapon , among other perspective military inventions , was subsequently reported to <unk> . stalin – the soviet army supreme commander . also at that period a.i . kitov , still being a student of the academy , was involved in the work of <unk> . korolev ’ s task force engaged in development of the soviet missile <unk> . in <year> , a. <unk> graduated from the full course of the academy with honors and a gold medal . diversified scientific and organizational activity of anatoly i. kitov has the following <integer> <unk> in his biography : === soviet military cybernetics initiatives === kitov was the first who implemented for the usage of the first computer ( the first soviet serial computer „ <unk> “ ) to the military ministry of the <unk> was the first in the ussr to organise and to head scientific work on solving military problems with the use of electronic computers . those were calculations for general staff of the ussr armed forces , for the main intelligence directorate , for main directorate of the land forces , for directorate of support , etc . already in the <unk> kitov developed main principles of <unk> automated <unk> and management systems for defence purposes . a big work was performed for implementing them in practical military usage . at the period between the years <year> and <year> kitov issued the fundamental and first in the ussr , series of scientific articles on military informatics ’ subjects . they were published by the journals `` military thought '' , `` <unk> '' , `` news of the f.e . <unk> artillery academy '' , also by periodical collections of works at the ussr ministry of defence and other `` special '' ( classified ) sources . in the computer center no <integer> ministry of defense of the ussr kitov was always the main initiator – „ <unk> of ideas '' , who set up the problems and was „ the brain '' of their solution , and of the scientific projects in general '' . a. kitov is the founder of soviet military cybernetics . === first computer department in the ussr === in <year> , a.i . kitov founded and headed the first soviet `` department of computers '' at the artillery academy . those time it was called a department of mathematical machines . also , at <year> a. kitov created the ussr first scientific phd dissertation on programming with the subject `` programming of the outer <unk> problems for the long range missiles '' . in <year> , a.i . kitov published pioneer scientific article , on thirty pages , `` implementation and usage of electronic computers '' . that was the first article in the ussr on the subject . at <year> a.i . kitov founded the first computer centre in the ussr . it was the computer centre no <integer> of the ussr ministry of defence ( cc no <integer> md ussr , secret number <integer> ) and he was the first <unk> of it . in <month> , <year> he was just <integer> , however enjoyed <unk> authority among his colleagues and subordinates . === creation of the ussr <unk> defense system === ballistic calculations for strategic rocket forces and for support of the first space flights took special place in the cc №1 work . description of the architecture of `` m-100 '' became a part of a.i . kitov ’ s thesis for doctor ’ s degree . the dissertation was titled `` implementation of computers for solving the problems of <unk> and <unk> defence . '' he <unk> defended it in <year> , at the `` closed '' ( for <unk> persons only ) meeting of the scientific council of the institute of management problems , as ussr . besides the `` m-100 '' , in his dissertation research kitov has also analysed principles of designing specialised military computers . he defined specific features of their structure , algorithmic programming language for solving complex of <unk> defence problems with the use of computers , and performed computer modelling of dynamical systems connected with air defence systems demands . === cybernetics science in the ussr === from <year> to <year> , cybernetics was officially called bourgeois pseudoscience in the ussr . in <unk> kitov read the book cybernetics by norbert <unk> in english . he found this book in the library of the secret <unk> . kitov not only realized the scientific and social value of cybernetics , but also wrote the first positive article in the ussr , `` the main features of cybernetics '' . it was very daring and could have ended with <unk> for kitov . after all , joseph stalin was still alive . but kitov began the struggle for the recognition of cybernetics in the ussr . in <unk> kitov lectured on cybernetics in well-known soviet organizations . kitov invited the venerable scientists sobolev and lyapunov to become co-authors of his article `` the main features of cybernetics '' . the article was published in the journal <unk> <unk> ( <year> , no . <integer> ) and for the first time presented the principles of cybernetics to the soviet audience . the victory for cybernetics was <unk> by the publication two months later of kitov 's article `` technical cybernetics '' in the popular technical monthly `` radio '' . in <unk> , the scientific works of a.i . kitov played a significant role in the recognition of cybernetics as a science and in its development in the ussr and other socialist countries . === new computers development === at the cc №1 a.i . kitov headed and participated in design and manufacturing of two new computers - `` m-100 '' and `` <unk> '' ( blow ) . both were successfully put into operation . computer `` m-100 '' was processing data , which were received form surveillance <unk> stations . `` <unk> '' was used at preparing ballistic missiles for launching . author ’ s certificate for invention given to a.i . kitov with his three colleagues with priority on <integer> <month> <year> for the principle of the parallel processing of instructions , . created by kitov this principle of statements parallel processing by the arithmetic device of computer , which is famous as `` <unk> processing '' is still in use by modern computers . kitov proposed to implement this principle at the cc no <integer> , where it was used for new computer `` m-100 '' , which was developed under kitov ’ s guidance . that time it was the <unk> <unk> computer ( first generation ) in the ussr and in the world – one hundred thousand computer instructions per second . in `` m-100 '' one of the first immediate access stores on <unk> <unk> were used . its two level addressing of operating memory device ( <unk> ) was important factor of increasing its performance . there were also some other principle <unk> , but they were classified , as the whole project was a secret one . special department of mathematical support had been established by kitov for designing computer `` m-100 '' . besides `` m-100 '' , in cc no <integer> for this computer was created a huge amount of software for processing information coming from <unk> of the soviet anti-aircraft defence systems . === writing on programming , computers and their applications === the books by a.i . kitov became a part of history of national science and university education as the first most complete sources on computer sciences , programming and automated management systems . kitov was the author of the first soviet book ( <year> ) and first soviet <unk> ( <year> ) on programming , computers and their applications . in common , he published <integer> scientific books translated at <integer> foreign languages . kitov 's books brought to general readers information and knowledge about the birth of new <unk> . === pioneering the automated management systems === in his first soviet computer book digital electronic machines ( <year> ) kitov published a big part „ <unk> usage of computers '' . large chapter of this book is dedicated to usage of computers in economy , automation of production processes and at solving other intellectual problems . in his another book „ electronic computing machines '' , released in <year> , kitov describes in details perspectives of complex automation in management , including management of industrial production and solving of economic problems . anatoly kitov is the author of the notion `` automated management systems - ams '' and also of the philosophy of the soviet `` ams '' . in his `` programming information and logic tasks '' ( <year> ) kitov presents `` <unk> programming '' technology – method for solving <unk> problems with large <unk> processing . programming language algem , created under a.i . kitov 's scientific guidance , was described . algem was used in the ussr and in the socialist countries of the east europe . in his next book `` programming of economical and management tasks '' a.i . kitov <unk> experience of his work as the chief designer of the automated management system ( ams ) for the ministry of <unk> . that system was recognised as the basic model for <unk> for the other nine ministries of the ussr weapon industry . the book presented basic principles of creation automated management systems for the plants and industry . === computer <unk> for the national economy management ( project `` red book '' ) === a.i . kitov was the first one to demonstrate necessity of creation of national automated system for management in the state economy and – simultaneously – in the armed forces , on basis of <unk> usage of electronic computers and mathematical methods . clear understanding of the ams development importance led kitov , at the end of <year> , to the conclusion about necessity of <unk> of management of the national economy and also of its armed forces . the main point was , that this automated management system should be based on national network of regional computer centres ( project `` red book '' ) . a.i . kitov is famous for being the first one in the world who suggested project of an global integrated computer network for automated management of both the ussr national economy and the armed forces , functioning of which would be based on computers and mathematical methods . he proposed that technological structure of that system would be a global , double purpose , computer network , covering the whole ussr territory . this network should consist of hundreds of computer centres maintained by specially qualified military personnel . in autumn of <year> a.i . kitov sent his second letter with his project of global computer network ( the project `` red book '' ) to the leader of ussr <unk> . khrushchev . === information retrieval systems === typical example of kitov ’ s scientific intuition consisted in his opinion on information retrieval systems . he aimed efforts of his cc №1 scientists at their development . creation of information retrieval systems became really `` pioneer direction '' not only for the ussr armed forces but for the whole soviet it as well . anatoly kitov initiated scientific works at the cc №1 on the mathematical linguistics and machine translation . kitov proposed to concentrate basic efforts not on direct increasing of performance , but first on development of methods , <unk> and programs which permitted to essentially extend processing , storage and retrieval <unk> information . === theory and practice of algorithmic programming languages === a. kitov is the creator of two algorithmic programming languages - algem and normin . compared with <unk> , algem was completed with new types of data , which made possible processing of not only numerical but also <unk> information and data groups of various types . during a long time algem was a `` working horse '' for the soviet <unk> , who were working in the field `` <unk> '' applications of computers , it was also used in numerous ams of various levels implemented in industry and administrative management structures , both in the ussr and in the socialist countries . in the <unk> while working as the <unk> of the ams ‘ healthcare ’ , a.i . kitov developed algorithmic programming language normin , which was widely used in the ussr for programming medical problems . that was the first , in the ussr , <unk> language for the information retrieval on <unk> natural language . taking under consideration that medical ams would be used by the people , who <unk> ’ t have special technical education kitov implemented special <unk> in his systems , which was <unk> and easily <unk> on intuition level as much as it was possible at the level of computer development of that time . the <unk> realised , among others , dialogue mode `` human – computer '' in <unk> natural language normin . === computers <unk> and <unk> === already in his letter to <unk> . khrushchev , from <unk> , kitov insisted that introduction of automated systems in the country should be conducted under supervision of the state administrator of high level – such as the member of the <unk> of the central committee of the communist party . the whole work in the field of computation means and automated management systems should be subjected to a single body of the soviet union state level <unk> <unk> which would be granted the monopoly to coordinate , control and implement all developments and achievements of that branch . `` only such organisation will grant successful progress , rational , without <unk> or <unk> chaotic actions '' . in his article ‘ computers – assistants in each thing ’ from <integer> <month> <year> , a.i . kitov <unk> , that : `` taking under consideration exceptional importance of the computer development for the national economy and for the state defence , and also considering the fact that production of these computation means is steadily increasing , the need in centralised control over the work of computation centres of all kinds and <unk> and in control and coordination of usage of single computers , belonging to various organisations , is getting clear . these measures will <unk> the most rational usage of computers in interests of the whole country '' . all that , kitov wanted to perform on the whole national scale , and wrote about it in many of his articles . unfortunately , all those ideas and proposals <unk> ’ t been heard and the bureaucratic machine was too slow . === projects in medical cybernetics === a.i . kitov has worked at health care and medicine more than ten years . in the <year>s a.i . kitov created for medical industry ams `` health care '' and became a recognised leader in this field both in the ussr and abroad . kitov managed to solve important scientific problems : information model of the soviet medical industry was created , unified software <unk> for <unk> and logical control of information <unk> were worked out . in fact , during his `` medical period '' a.i . kitov started scientific research practically from the zero point and moved medical informatics of the ussr several tens of years ahead . within the healthcare field he established scientific school , brought up number of talented followers , number of dissertation works were completed under his guidance . he also published several conceptual articles and three monographs : `` automation of information processing and management in the healthcare field '' ( <year> ) . `` introduction into medical cybernetics '' ( <year> ) and `` medical cybernetics '' ( <year> ) . a.i . kitov made great contribution to creation of `` local '' medical <unk> , which functioned within specific enterprises – at hospitals , clinics , <unk> . the first ams of that type operated at the clinical hospital no <integer> subjected to the third directorate of the ussr ministry of health . later this ams supported a great deal of work at <unk> and rehabilitation of victims of chernobyl power station catastrophe of <year>. even there he managed to be a pioneer – the founder of soviet medical cybernetics . during <integer> years a.i . kitov was the national representative of the ussr at influential organisations in the field of medical informatics at the united nations and the unesco : • international federation of medical informatics : ( medinfo ) . • international medical informatics association : officer of <unk> . • technical committee <unk> of international federation for information processing ( <unk> <unk> ) . he participated in organization of three international <unk> <unk> : <unk> world congress of medinfo – <year> ( <unk> ) , <unk> world congress of medinfo – <year> ( toronto ) , <unk> world congress of medinfo – <year> ( tokyo ) . a.i . kitov at these <unk> was the member of organizing committee and <unk> committee . about a thousand scientists from developed countries gathered at <unk> . a.i . kitov was a chairman of the section on biomedical <unk> ( session <unk> – « biomedical research general » ) . === pedagogical activity === pedagogical activity took important place in a.i . kitov ’ s work . as it is clearly visible from his biography , he had born interest for acquiring knowledge and their <unk> ; passing them to those who surrounded him . for great many of it specialists a.i . kitov is famous , first of all , as the author of the first soviet books and textbooks on computing and programming . else at the <year>–1952 , at the artillery academy name f.e . dzerzhinsky a.i . kitov conducted one of the three , first in the ussr , courses of lectures on computers and programming . more than <integer> post <unk> , both soviet and foreign , prepared and defended <unk> under kitov ’ s scientific supervision . in <year> , when a.i . kitov already had rich experience of scientific work and of teaching , he received position at the russian <unk> . plekhanov university of economics , where he

'' == <unk> == tsedenbal was forced into retirement in <month> <year> in a <unk> move , officially on the account of his old age and mental weakness but at least partly because of his opposition to the process of sino-soviet <unk> that had started with leonid brezhnev 's tashkent speech in <month> <year>. <unk> batmönkh became the general secretary of the mprp . tsedenbal was removed a month after receiving vietnamese head of state <unk> <unk> and just days away before he was due to attend a ceremony in honor of the <days> anniversary of the <unk> victory in the battle of khalkhin gol . == later life and death == tsedenbal remained in moscow until his death . during this period , tsedenbal repeatedly asked the central committee of the mprp and the mongolian embassy in moscow to visit him , but no one accepted his request . in <year> , he was <unk> of the title of hero of the mpr , mongolian state awards and the military rank of marshal of the mpr . he died on <integer> <month> <year> at a moscow hospital . according to a medical report , the cause of death was `` <unk> <unk> cancer , <unk> poisoning and chronic liver failure .

<month> <year> – <integer> <month> <year> ) was a colombian lawyer and politician who served as the <days> president of colombia from <year> to <year>. he also held the positions of foreign minister and ambassador to the united states . == <unk> data == turbay was born in a rich neighborhood of “ voto nacional ” , bogotá , on <month> <integer> , <year>. his father , antonio <unk> turbay , was a businessman who emigrated from <unk> , lebanon . his mother , <unk> ayala , was a peasant from the province of <unk> . turbay ’ s father , a hard working merchant , had built a fortune , which he completely lost during the civil war of the thousand days war . turbay ayala completed his secondary studies in bogotá , but never attended college , and instead became an <unk> , a fact that his political adversaries always <unk> fun at . he received a number of honorary degrees later in life . == political career == turbay started his political career in the liberal party as a <unk> in the ( then ) town of <unk> in <year>. he would later be appointed as major of the city of <unk> ( <year> ) , and then <unk> in the town of <unk> in <year> along with fellow politicians <unk> lópez michelsen and álvaro <unk> <unk> . the next few years he spent as a member of the assembly of <unk> . in <year> he was chosen for congress as a chamber representative . he was a leader of the opposition to conservative governments , and in <year> became a member of the national directive of the liberal party . with the rise to power of the military junta that ousted dictator <unk> <unk> <unk> , turbay was appointed minister of mines and petroleum . he was later appointed minister of foreign affairs by president alberto <unk> <unk> until <year>. he was known as a strong defender of the national front , and was chosen as senator for four <unk> periods between <year> and <year>. he also served briefly as interim president in <year>. he was also appointed as ambassador the un ( <unk> ) , united kingdom ( <year>-1974 ) , and the united states ( <year>-1976 ) . he first attempted to become a presidential candidate in <year> , but ended up supporting lópez michelsen , who won the elections that year . the sector supporting lópez michelsen was instrumental in turbay 's presidential campaign of <year> , and after a very narrow election he became president of colombia in <year> . == presidency == === <year> security statute === in response to an increase in guerrilla activity from the <days> of <month> movement ( m-19 ) and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , as well as to the colombian communist party 's attempts to extend its political influence and a <year> national strike , a <year> decree , known as the security statute , was implemented by turbay 's administration . the security statute gave the military an increased degree of freedom of action , especially in urban areas , to <unk> , <unk> and eventually judge suspected guerrillas or their collaborators before military <unk> . human rights organizations , newspaper <unk> , political <unk> and opposition groups complained about an increase in the number of arbitrary <unk> and acts of torture as a result . although the security statute allegedly benefited some of the counterinsurgency operations of the security forces , such as the capture of most of the m-19 's command structure and many of the guerrilla group 's urban cells , the measure became highly unpopular inside and outside colombia , promoting some measure of public sympathy for the victims of the real or perceived military abuses whether they were guerrillas or not , and was <unk> out towards the end of the turbay administration . === <year> dominican embassy crisis === the m-19 's late <year> <unk> of the dominican republic 's embassy , during which sixteen <unk> were held hostage for <integer> days , presented a complicated challenge to the turbay <unk> incident soon spread throughout worldwide <unk> , as <unk> from the united states of america , costa rica , mexico , peru , israel and venezuela had been taken hostage , as well as colombia 's top representative to the holy see . turbay , despite pressure from military and political sectors , avoided deciding to solve the crisis through the use of direct military force , and instead eventually agreed to let the m-19 rebels travel to cuba . allegedly , the rebels also received <unk> <integer> million as <unk> , instead of the initial $ <integer> million that they had originally demanded from the government . that a mostly peaceful resolution to the crisis was found has been generally considered as a positive aspect of turbay 's administration , as seen by later and contemporary commentators and historians . in particular , former m-19 members , including <unk> <unk> , the commander of the guerrilla group 's <unk> unit at the time , later recognized and respected turbay 's handling of the situation . == <unk> == turbay was a supporter of president álvaro uribe . he initially opposed the possibility of presidential reelection in colombia , but later changed his views , contributing to founding a movement known as <unk> <unk> ( `` new <unk> '' ) , in order to help promote uribe 's <year> reelection aspirations . === support for a prisoner exchange with the farc === turbay was seen as being at odds with some of uribe 's policies , however , in particular due to turbay 's activism in favor of the implementation and negotiation of a prisoner exchange with the farc guerrilla group . as part of this effort , turbay participated in several meetings with the relatives of farc hostages and signed several <unk> of support , together with other former presidents such as <unk> lópez michelsen and ernesto <unk> <unk> . on <month> <integer> , <year> , turbay proposed that the government could exchange each <unk> guerrilla for <integer> `` economic '' hostages ( those held for extortion purposes ) and one `` political '' hostage ( those held by the farc in order to pressure the colombian government to release its <unk> members ) . == personal life == turbay married his niece , <unk> <unk> turbay , on <month> <integer> , <year>. they had four children together : julio césar , diana , <unk> , and maría victoria . however , their marriage was <unk> by the roman catholic church , and in <year> he married his longtime

'' after his return to england in early <month> <year> , his mother mary was remarried to lionel smith ( <year>–1972 ) , the eldest son of a. l. smith , whose daughter dorothy was also married to alan 's uncle robert howard <unk> autumn of <year> hodgkin started as a freshman scholar at trinity college , cambridge where his friends included <unk> john raven and michael grant , <unk> richard <unk> and john h. humphrey , as well as <unk> and david hill , the children of nobel laureate archibald hill . he took physiology with chemistry and zoology for the first two years , including lectures by nobel laureate <unk> . adrian . for part ii of the tripos he decided to focus on physiology instead of zoology . nevertheless , he participated in a zoological expedition to the atlas mountains in morocco led by john pringle in <year>. he finished part ii of the tripos in <month> <year> and stayed at trinity as a research <unk> his studies , hodgkin , who described himself as `` having been brought up as a supporter of the british labour party '' was friends with communists and actively participated in distribution of anti-war pamphlets . at cambridge , he knew james <unk> and john <unk> , but he <unk> in his autobiography that none of his friends `` made any serious effort to convert me [ to communism ] , either then or later . '' from <year> to <year> , hodgkin was a member of the cambridge <unk> . == <unk> research == hodgkin started conducting experiments on how electrical activity is transmitted in the <unk> nerve of frogs in <month> <year>. he found that a nerve impulse arriving at a cold or <unk> block , can decrease the electrical threshold beyond the block , suggesting that the impulse produces a spread of an <unk> potential in the nerve beyond the block . in <year> , hodgkin was invited by herbert <unk> , then director of the rockefeller institute in new york city , to work in his laboratory during <unk> . there he met <unk> <unk> de <unk> and kenneth stewart cole with whom he ended up publishing a paper . during that year he also spent time at the woods hole marine biological laboratory where he was introduced to the squid giant axon , which ended up being the model system with which he conducted most of the research that eventually led to his nobel prize . in spring <year> he visited joseph <unk> at washington university in st. louis who told him he would take hodgkin 's local circuit theory of nerve impulse propagation seriously if he could show that <unk> the resistance of the fluid outside a nerve fibre made a difference to the velocity of nerve impulse conduction . working with single nerve fibres from shore <unk> and <unk> , he showed that the conduction rate was much faster in sea water than in oil , providing strong evidence for the local circuit <unk> his return to cambridge he started collaborating with andrew huxley who had entered trinity as a freshman in <year> , three years after hodgkin . with a <unk> equipment grant from the rockefeller foundation , hodgkin managed to set up a similar physiology <unk> to the one he had worked with at the rockefeller institute . he moved all his equipment to the plymouth marine laboratory in <month> <year>. there , he and huxley managed to <unk> a fine <unk> into the giant axon of <unk> and record action potentials from inside the nerve fibre . they sent a short note of their success to nature just before the outbreak of world war ii . == wartime activities == despite his quaker upbringing , hodgkin was eager to join the war effort as contact with the nazis during his stay in germany in <year> had removed all his <unk> beliefs . his first post was at the royal aircraft establishment where he worked on issues in aviation medicine , such as <unk> supply for pilots at high altitude and the <unk> sickness caused by <unk> bubbles coming out of the blood . in <month> <year> he transferred to the telecommunications research establishment ( <unk> ) where he worked on the development of <unk> radar , including the design of the village <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> system . he was a member of e.g . bowen 's group in st <unk> in south wales and lived in a local guest house together with john pringle and robert <unk> brown . the group moved to <unk> in <month> <year> where pringle replaced bowen as leader of the group . in <month> <year> , hodgkin flew on the test flight of a bristol <unk> <unk> with the first <unk> <unk> radar system . in <month> and <month> <year> , hodgkin visited the mit radiation laboratory to help foster the interchange of information on developments in radar between britain and <unk> a readable account of the little-known piece of military history that he was a part of during world war ii was a main motivation for hodgkin to write his autobiography chance and design : reminiscences of science in peace and war . == <year>–1963 : action potential theory and nobel prize == as the allied forces ' invasion of france and their continued advance towards germany in autumn <year> suggested an end of the war in the <unk> future , hodgkin started to plan his return to a career in research at cambridge . he renewed his collaboration with w. a. h. <unk> and they published an article on how to calculate a nerve fibre 's membrane resistance , membrane capacity , its <unk> 's resistance , and the resistance of the external fluid in which the fibre is placed , from experimental <unk> being released from military service in <month> <year> upon adrian 's request , hodgkin was able to <unk> his experiments in collaboration with bernard katz and his <unk> collaborator andrew huxley . they spent the summers of <year> , <year> , and <year> at the plymouth marine laboratory where they continued to measure resting and action potentials from inside the giant axon of the squid . together with katz , he provided evidence that the permeability of the neuronal cell membrane for sodium increased during an action potential , thus allowing sodium ions to diffuse <unk> . the data they had obtained in <year> resulted in a series of five papers published in the journal of physiology that described what became later known as the <unk> model of the action potential and eventually earned hodgkin and huxley the nobel prize in physiology or medicine . building on work by kenneth s. cole they used a technique of <unk> , known as the voltage <unk> to measure ionic currents through the <unk> of squid axons , while holding the membrane voltage at a set level . they proposed that the characteristic shape of the action potential is caused by changes in the selective permeability of the membrane for different ions , specifically sodium , potassium , and <unk> . a model that relies on a set of differential equations and describes each component of an <unk> cell as an electrical element was in good agreement with their empirical measurements . the cell membrane <unk> sequence where a small <unk> leads to an increase in sodium permeability , which leads to influx of sodium ions , which in turn <unk> the membrane even more is now known as the hodgkin <unk> addition , hodgkin and huxley 's findings led them to <unk> the existence of ion channels on cell <unk> , which were confirmed only decades later . confirmation of ion channels came with the development of the <unk> <unk> leading to a nobel prize in <year> for erwin <unk> and bert <unk> , and in <year> for <unk> <unk> establishing ion movements across a <unk> <unk> cell membrane as the mechanism of the action potential , hodgkin turned his attention to how the ionic interchange that occurs during the action potential could be reversed afterwards . together with richard keynes he demonstrated that in addition to the changes in permeability that lead to an action potential there is a <unk> mechanism that <unk> sodium and <unk> potassium against the <unk> <unk> . a few year later , the danish scientist jens christian <unk> discovered the enzyme <unk> that uses <unk> to export three sodium ions in exchange for two potassium ions that are imported , for which he received the nobel prize in chemistry in <year> . hodgkin was nominated for the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in <year> by lord adrian . in <month> <year> , he was told by swedish journalists that he , huxley , and eccles had been awarded the nobel prize . this turned out to be a false alarm , however , when shortly thereafter it was announced that the <year> prize was awarded to georg von <unk> . it was only two years later that hodgkin , huxley , and eccles were finally awarded the prize `` for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in <unk> and <unk> in the peripheral and central <unk> of the nerve cell membrane '' . during the nobel <unk> on <integer> <month> <year> , hodgkin gave the traditional speech on behalf of the three <unk> , <unk> the king and the nobel committee for physiology or medicine for the award . <unk> , hodgkin and his wife attended the nobel prize ceremony a second time , three years later , when hodgkin 's father-in-law

<unk> of carbon known as a <unk> . other <unk> of carbon include <unk> , diamond and <unk> . harry kroto 's <year> paper entitled `` c60 : <unk> '' , published with colleagues j. r. heath , s. c. o'brien , r. f. curl , and r. e. smalley , was honored by a citation for chemical breakthrough award from the division of history of chemistry of the american chemical society , presented to rice university in <year>. the discovery of fullerenes was recognized in <year> by the designation of a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society at the richard e. smalley institute for nanoscale science and technology at rice university in houston , texas . === nanotechnology === following nearly a decade 's worth of research into the formation of alternate <unk> compounds ( e.g . <unk> , <unk> ) , as well as the synthesis of <unk> <unk> ( m <unk> c60 ) , reports of the identification of carbon <unk> structures led smalley to begin investigating their <unk> <unk> a consequence of this research , smalley was able to persuade the administration of rice university , under <unk> malcolm <unk> , to create rice 's center for nanoscale science and technology ( <unk> ) focusing on any aspect of molecular nanotechnology . it was renamed the richard e. smalley institute for nanoscale science and technology after smalley 's death in <year> , and has since merged with the rice quantum institute , becoming the <unk> institute ( sci ) in <unk> 's <unk> research was focused on carbon <unk> , specifically focusing on the chemical synthesis side of <unk> research . he is well known for his group 's invention of the <unk> carbon <unk> ( <unk> ) method of producing large <unk> of <unk> <unk> . smalley <unk> off his work into a company , carbon <unk> inc. and associated <unk> . === dispute on molecular assemblers === he was an outspoken skeptic of the idea of molecular assemblers , as advocated by k. eric drexler . his main scientific <unk> , which he termed the `` fat fingers problem '' and the `` <unk> fingers problem '' , argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual <unk> . he also believed that drexler 's speculations about <unk> dangers of molecular assemblers threatened the public support for development of nanotechnology . he debated drexler in an exchange of letters which were published in chemical & engineering news as a <unk> feature . == advocacy == starting in the late <year>s , smalley advocated for the need for cheap , clean energy , which he described as the number one problem facing humanity in the <days> century . he described what he called `` the <unk> challenge '' , the need to develop a new power source capable of increasing `` our energy output by a minimum factor of two , the generally <unk> number , certainly by the middle of the century , but <unk> well before that . `` he also presented a list entitled `` top ten problems of humanity for next <integer> years '' . it can be interesting to compare his list , in order of priority , to the ten threats formulated by the <unk> 's high level threat panel in <year>. smalley 's list , in order of priority , was : energy water food environment poverty terrorism & war disease education democracy <unk> regarded several problems as <unk> : the lack of people entering the fields of science and engineering , the need for an alternative to fossil <unk> , and the need to address global warming . he felt that improved science education was essential , and <unk> to encourage young students to consider careers in science . his slogan for this effort was `` be a scientist , save the world . `` smalley was a leading advocate of the national nanotechnology initiative in <year>. suffering from <unk> loss and weakness as a result of his <unk> treatments , smalley testified before the congressional <unk> , arguing for the potential benefits of nanotechnology in the development of targeted cancer therapies . bill <integer> , the <days> century nanotechnology research and development act , was introduced in the senate on <month> <integer> , <year> by senator ron <unk> , passed the senate

experimental design bureau working on projects such as the development of the first soviet icbm as well in the sputnik and vostok programs . he became head of korolev 's <unk> design bureau and was the chief designer after korolev 's death in <year> , during surgery to remove a tumor from korolev 's <unk> . he inherited the n1 rocket program , intended to land a man on the moon , but which turned out to be <unk> <unk> ( largely due to lack of adequate funding ) . n1 development began on <month> <integer> , <year> , a decade before mishin took control . it was selected for a lunar

failures mishin faced during his leadership could have been avoided if further testing had been conducted at this stage . to handle engine failures , the kord system was created under mishin . to prevent the rocket from having <unk> flight that would result from the <unk> thrust caused by a <unk> motor , the <unk> motor and the motor opposite it in the rocket base would be turned off . kord would also make the calculations necessary to <unk> for the missing motors , which would allow the same flight path to be <unk> n1 , despite its necessity for planned missions , was never successfully

as proper deployment of the <unk> safety system . the second launch , on <month> <integer> , experienced failure <unk> after <unk> , causing the rocket to fall back on the <unk> and create significant damage . the third n1 launch occurred on <month> <integer> , <year> , after improvements were made to kord , the <unk> , and fuel <unk> , and the addition of an <unk> system and <unk> . before the launch , the individual engines were further tested and the <unk> was repaired . for the first time all thirty engines of the first stage fired successfully , which was the cause of the failure of the flight . when all engines fired together , it created unexpectedly high roll ( rotation along the axis of thrust ) , which was beyond the strength of the <unk> vernier engines , designed to keep stable flight . this was another failure that might have been prevented with proper ground <unk> the fourth and what would become the final flight of the n1 , further <unk> were made , including four

prosperity reaching down to the masses , there existed a choice of methods . first , there was the choice between the democratic and <unk> systems , the latter prevailing in communist countries . on this , the choice was easy as <unk> had long been committed to the democratic method . with the democratic mechanism , however , the next choice was between free enterprise and the continuing of the controls system . macapagal stated the essence of free enterprise in <unk> <unk> in declaring before congress on <month> <integer> , <year> , that `` the task of economic development belongs <unk> to private enterprise and not to the government . before independence there was free enterprise in the philippines under presidents manuel quezon , sergio <unk> and manuel roxas . in <year> president elpidio quirino <unk> from free enterprise launching as a temporary emergency measure the system of exchange and import controls . the controls system was carried on by president magsaysay and <unk> first fundamental decision macapagal had to make was whether to continue the system of exchange controls of quirino , magsaysay and garcia or to return to the free enterprise of quezon , <unk> and roxas . it had been his view since he was a congressman for eight years that the suitable economic system for <unk> was free enterprise . so on <month> <integer> , <year> , after working for <integer>

were blocked by the <unk> , who dominated the house of representatives and the senate at that time . nonetheless , macapagal was able to achieve steady economic progress , and annual gdp growth <unk> at <decimal> % for <unk> . ==== socio-economic program ==== the removal of controls and the restoration of free enterprise was intended to provide only the fundamental setting in which macapagal could work out economic and social progress . a specific and <unk> program for the guidance of both the private sector and the government was an essential instrument to <unk> the economic and social development that constituted the goal of his <unk> a program for his administration was formulated under his authority and direction by a group of able and <unk> economic and business leaders the most active and effective of which was <unk> roxas iii . from an examination of the planned targets and requirements of the five-year program – formally known as the five-year socio-economic integrated development program – it could be seen that it aimed at the following objectives . immediate restoration of economic stability ; <unk> the plight of the common man ; and establishing a dynamic basic for future <unk> enterprise was restored with <unk> . the five-year economic program had been <unk> . land reform abolishing <unk> had been launched . these were essential foundations for economic and social progress for the greatest <unk> essential foundations having been laid , attention must then be turned to the equally difficult task of building the main <unk> by implementing the economic program . although the success of macapagal 's socio-economic program in free enterprise inherently depended on the private sector , it would be helpful and necessary for the government to <unk> active assistance in its implementation by the <unk> role of the government in free enterprise , in the view of macapagal , required it ( <integer> ) to provide the social overhead like roads , airfields and ports that directly or <unk> promote economic growth , ( <integer> ) to adopt fiscal and monetary policies <unk> to investments , and most importantly ( <integer> ) to serve as an entrepreneur or promote of basic and key private industries , particularly those that require capital too large for businessmen to put up by themselves . among the enterprises he selected for active government promotion were integrated steel , <unk> , <unk> , meat <unk> and tourism . ==== land reform ==== like ramon magsaysay , president diosdado macapagal came from the masses . he <unk> calling himself the `` poor boy from lubao '' . <unk> , he had little popularity among the masses . this could be attributed to an absence any charismatic appeal owing to his <unk> personality . but despite this , macapagal had certain achievements . foremost of these was the agricultural land reform code of <year> ( republic act no . <integer> ) which provided for the purchase of private <unk> with the intention of <unk> them in small lots to the <unk> <unk> on easy term of <unk> . it is a major development in history of land reform in the philippines , in comparison with the previous agrarian legislation , the law <unk> the <unk> limit to <integer> <unk> , whether owned by individuals or corporations . it removed the term `` <unk> '' and established the <unk> system . the <unk> or the <unk> system was prohibited . it formulated a bill of rights that assured agricultural workers the right to self-organization and to a minimum wage . it also created an office that acquired and distributed <unk> and a financing institution for this purpose . the major <unk> of this law was , however , that it had several <unk> , such as <unk> ( big capital <unk> established during the spanish and american periods ) ; <unk> , <unk> , and lands primarily <unk> to citrus , <unk> , <unk> , coffee , <unk> , and other similar permanent trees ; <unk> converted to residential , commercial , industrial , or other similar <unk> <unk> was viewed that the <unk> <unk> limit was just too high for the growing population density . moreover , this law merely allowed the transfer of the <unk> from one area to another . this was because <unk> were paid in bonds , which he could use to purchase agricultural lands . likewise , the farmer was free to choose to be excluded from the <unk> arrangements if he volunteered to give up the <unk> to the <unk> two years after the law was implemented , no land was being purchased under its term and conditions caused by the peasants ' inability to purchase the land . besides , the government seemed lacking of strong political will , as shown by the congress ' <unk> of only one million philippine <unk> for the implementation of this code . at least <unk> million was needed within a year from the <unk> and implementation of the code , and <unk> million in the next three years for the program to be successful . however , by <year> , the code had benefited only <unk> peasants covering <integer> <unk> , at the cost of <unk> million to the government . consequently , by the <year>s , the farmers ended up <unk> less land , with their share in the farm also being less . they incurred more debts , depending on the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . indeed , during the administration of macapagal , the productivity of the farmers further declined . ==== <unk> drive ==== one of macapagal 's major campaign <unk> had been to clean out the government corruption that had <unk> under former president garcia . the administration also openly <unk> with filipino businessmen fernando lopez and eugenio lopez , brothers who had controlling interests in several large businesses . the administration <unk> to the brothers as `` filipino <unk> who build and maintain business empires through political power , including the corruption of politicians and other officials '' . in the <year> election , the <unk> threw their support behind macapagal 's rival , ferdinand marcos , with fernando lopez serving marcos ' running <unk> . <unk> stonehill controversy <unk> the administration 's campaign against corruption was tested by harry stonehill , an american <unk> with a $ <unk> business empire in the philippines . macapagal 's secretary of justice , jose w. diokno investigated stonehill on charges of tax <unk> , smuggling , <unk> of imports , and corruption of public officials . diokno 's investigation revealed stonehill 's ties to corruption within the government . macapagal , however , prevented diokno from <unk> stonehill by <unk> the american instead , then <unk> diokno from the cabinet . diokno questioned macapagal 's actions , saying , `` how can the government now <unk> the <unk> when it has allowed the <unk> to go
